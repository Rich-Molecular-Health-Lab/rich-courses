                  currently available. Concerns about big cat use are
                  increasingly of strong public interest and the lack of data

                  impacting zoological industry function, conservation programs,

                  compiled using publicly available USDA (United States
                  Department of Agriculture) records and direct information
                  requests. The resulting census was derived from the animal
                  inventories listed on inspection records for all 2272
                  facilities with animal exhibition licenses. The total number
                  of big cats in federally regulated facilities is on the order
                  of 4100 animals and appears to be declining.},

  abstract     = {There is relatively little work examining visitor outcomes of
                  ambassador animal programs, such as whether these programs are
                  educationally effective or unintentionally promote exotic pet
                  ownership. We designed a two-way factorial experiment to test
                  whether ambassador animals enhanced or detracted from the
                  educational outcomes of a zoo exhibit. We surveyed 312
                  visitors at the Oakland Zoo at a static exhibit focused on the
                  illegal wildlife trade. Participants were surveyed either
                  before or after visiting the exhibit, with or without a
                  trainer presenting either an ambassador ball python (Python
                  regius) or yellow-naped Amazon parrot (Amazona auropalliata).
                  The survey assessed attitudes toward conservation, knowledge
                  of conservation behavior, and the suitability of various
                  species, including the ambassador species, as pets. We used an
                  ANOVA to examine 299 complete surveys for differences between
                  experimental groups' mean responses. There were no significant
                  differences in conservation attitudes. Subjects demonstrated
                  more knowledge of conservation behavior after leaving the
                  exhibit, regardless of whether or not an animal was present.
                  While the exhibit reduced favorable attitudes toward parrots
                  as pets, ambassador animal presence neither positively nor
                  negatively impacted on this effect. Participants who viewed a
                  python were more likely to indicate that they viewed a python
                  as a good pet. However, the sample expressed overall negative
                  attitudes toward exotic pet ownership. This study suggests
                  that ambassadors neither enhanced learning nor unintentionally
                  promoted exotic pets. Further research is needed to understand
                  the role of interpretive messaging when using ambassadors in
                  an educational context.},
