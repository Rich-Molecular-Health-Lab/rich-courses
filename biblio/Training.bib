  abstract     = {Husbandry training and environmental enrichment are both
                  important advancements associated with current behavioural
                  welfare practices. Additionally, the use of training
                  procedures has been proposed as a form of enrichment, with the
                  implication that training can produce beneficial behavioural
                  welfare results. This paper examines the concept of training
                  as enrichment through three distinct ways training procedures
                  could enrich: (i) training facilitates enrichment usage; (ii)
                  training modifies interactions, conspecific or otherwise; and
                  (iii) training expands behavioural repertoires. Within each
                  category, the paper focuses on past research that provides
                  empirical support for training functioning as enrichment, as
                  well as related areas of research that provide additional
                  evidence. Previous studies support the claim that training is
                  enriching, with additional research necessary to better
                  understand how prevalent and under what conditions training
                  procedures function as enrichment. Future training research
                  should examine these potential enrichment effects, including
                  methodology that allows for comparisons to traditional
                  enrichment, the use of welfare diversity/variability indices,
                  and the effects of learning on trainers and trainees alike.},

  abstract     = {Simple Summary Conditioned reinforcement, for example, clicker
                  training, has become increasingly popular in recent decades.
                  Hence, questions about the effectiveness of the conditioned
                  reinforcer have become prominent in the animal training arena.
                  This article summarizes the scientific literature on
                  conditioned reinforcement in applied animal training settings
                  (e.g., homes). It was found that dogs and horses were the most
                  frequently studied animals. Clickers and food were the most
                  often used training stimuli. Effect size analysis found a
                  medium effect of clicker training. The literature reviewed
                  here shows that conditioned reinforcement is an effective
                  approach to change animal behavior; however, sizable
                  information potentially related to its effectiveness was not
                  clearly reported in the studies (e.g., food preferences).
                  Although this review fills in a gap in the literature, it also
                  points to the need for more research to further the
                  understanding of conditioned reinforcement phenomena. Abstract
                  A conditioned reinforcer is a stimulus that acquired its
                  effectiveness to increase and maintain a target behavior on
                  the basis of the individual’s history—e.g., pairings with
                  other reinforcers. This systematic review synthesized findings
                  on conditioned reinforcement in the applied animal training
                  field. Thirty-four studies were included in the review and six
                  studies were eligible for a meta-analysis on the effectiveness
                  of behavioral interventions that implemented conditioned
                  reinforcement (e.g., clicks, spoken word, or whistles paired
                  with food). The majority of studies investigated conditioned
                  reinforcement with dogs (47\%, n = 16) and horses (30\%, n =
                  10) implementing click–food pairings. All other species (cats,
                  cattle, fish, goats, and monkeys) were equally distributed
                  across types of conditioned (e.g., clicker or spoken word) and
                  unconditioned reinforcers (e.g., food, water, or tactile). A
                  meta-analysis on the effectiveness of conditioned
                  reinforcement in behavioral interventions found a medium
                  summary effect size (Tau-U 0.77; CI95\% = [0.53, 0.89]), when
                  comparing baseline, where no training was done, and treatment
                  levels. Moderators of conditioned reinforcement effectiveness
                  were species (e.g., horses) and research design (e.g.,
                  multiple-baseline designs). The small number of
                  intervention-focused studies available limits the present
                  findings and highlights the need for more systematic research
                  into the effectiveness of conditioned reinforcement across
                  species.},

  abstract     = {The ability to predict regular events can be adaptive for
                  nonhuman animals living in an otherwise unpredictable
                  environment. Animals may exhibit behavioral changes preceding
                  a predictable event; such changes reflect anticipatory
                  behavior. Anticipatory behavior is broadly defined as a
                  goal-directed increase in activity preceding a predictable
                  event and can be useful for assessing well being in animals in
                  captivity. Anticipation may look different in different
                  animals, however, necessitating methods to generate and study
                  anticipatory behaviors across species. This article includes a
                  proposed method for generating and describing anticipatory
                  behavior in zoos using behavioral conditioning. The article
                  also includes discussion of case studies of the proposed
                  method with 2 animals at the San Francisco Zoo: a silverback
                  gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and a red panda (Ailurus
                  fulgens). The study evidence supports anticipation in both
                  animals. As behavioral conditioning can be used with many
                  animals, the proposed method provides a practical approach for
                  using anticipatory behavior to assess animal well being in
                  zoos.},

  abstract     = {The management of African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian
                  (Elephas maximus) elephants in zoos involves a range of
                  practices including feeding, exercise, training, and
                  environmental enrichment. These practices are necessary to
                  meet the elephants' nutritional, healthcare, and husbandry
                  needs. However, these practices are not standardized,
                  resulting in likely variation among zoos as well as
                  differences in the way they are applied to individual
                  elephants within a zoo. To characterize elephant management in
                  North America, we collected survey data from zoos accredited
                  by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, developed 26
                  variables, generated population level descriptive statistics,
                  and analyzed them to identify differences attributable to sex
                  and species. Sixty-seven zoos submitted surveys describing the
                  management of 224 elephants and the training experiences of
                  227 elephants. Asian elephants spent more time managed
                  (defined as interacting directly with staff) than Africans
                  (mean time managed: Asians = 56.9\%; Africans = 48.6\%;
                  p<0.001), and managed time increased by 20.2\% for every year
                  of age for both species. Enrichment, feeding, and exercise
                  programs were evaluated using diversity indices, with mean
                  scores across zoos in the midrange for these measures. There
                  were an average of 7.2 feedings every 24-hour period, with
                  only 1.2 occurring during the nighttime. Feeding schedules
                  were predictable at 47.5\% of zoos. We also calculated the
                  relative use of rewarding and aversive techniques employed
                  during training interactions. The population median was seven
                  on a scale from one (representing only aversive stimuli) to
                  nine (representing only rewarding stimuli). The results of our
                  study provide essential information for understanding
                  management variation that could be relevant to welfare.
                  Furthermore, the variables we created have been used in
                  subsequent elephant welfare analyses.},
