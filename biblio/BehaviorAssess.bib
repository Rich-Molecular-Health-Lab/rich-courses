  abstract     = {Simple Summary Zoos and aquariums have recognized the
                  paramount importance of animal welfare. Achieving and
                  maintaining the highest possible standards of animal welfare
                  is not only a moral obligation but also a necessary condition
                  for zoos and aquariums to fulfil their educational and
                  conservational functions. However, evaluating the welfare of
                  zoo animals presents a challenge due to the wide range of
                  species involved and a lack of knowledge regarding the
                  specific requirements of each species. Therefore, to protect
                  and promote the welfare of zoo animals, there is a need for
                  science-based tools to assess and monitor it. This review
                  article aims to discuss the advantages and limitations of
                  existing methodologies for assessing animal welfare in zoos,
                  describe the main animal-based welfare indicators for zoo
                  animals, and identify areas that require further research.
                  Abstract Zoological institutions, such as zoos and aquariums,
                  have made animal welfare a top priority, as it is not only a
                  moral obligation but also crucial for fulfilling their roles
                  in education and conservation. There is a need for
                  science-based tools to assess and monitor animal welfare in
                  these settings. However, assessing the welfare of zoo animals
                  is challenging due to the diversity of species and lack of
                  knowledge on their specific needs. This review aims to discuss
                  the advantages and disadvantages of existing methodologies for
                  assessing zoo animal welfare through: (1) A critical analysis
                  of the main approaches to zoo animal welfare assessment; (2) A
                  description of the most relevant animal-based welfare
                  indicators for zoo animals with a particular focus on
                  behavioural and physiological indicators; and (3) An
                  identification of areas that require further research.},

  abstract     = {Simple Summary Animals in zoos can adapt to many noises they
                  hear on a regular basis. However, construction noise that is
                  intense or occurs unpredictably may negatively impact the
                  welfare state of some animals and induce a chronic stress
                  response. This study aimed to understand the behavioral
                  response to construction noise of selected species in an urban
                  zoo in order to guide mitigating actions in advance of, and
                  during, a planned construction project. The behavior of
                  elephants, giraffes, emus and alligators was recorded during
                  90-min exposures to different sound environments including
                  ambient sound, and four construction sound treatments. A
                  non-invasive measure of physiological stress response was also
                  measured in emus. All species appeared to respond to the
                  recorded noise, with giraffes, elephants and emu,
                  demonstrating behavioral changes potentially indicative of
                  agitation or stress. This study has implications for the
                  trade-offs that occur when zoos seek to improve long-term
                  animal welfare through enclosure refurbishment and short-term
                  impacts on animals exposed to construction noise. Abstract In
                  anticipation of a major construction project in an urban New
                  Zealand zoo, a study was initiated to assess the response to
                  construction noise of selected animal species (elephant,
                  giraffe, emu and alligator) previously observed to be
                  sensitive to this kind of noise. The overall aim was to detect
                  any signs of aversive responses to this noise to enable
                  keepers to recognize these and take any necessary mitigating
                  actions during the construction period. The experimental
                  approach involved the creation of acoustic maps of each focal
                  animal enclosure, a series of 90-min video recordings of the
                  animals’ behavior in response to ambient noise (control) and
                  amplified broadcast of pre-recorded continuous and
                  intermittent construction noise. Concentration of fecal
                  corticosterone metabolites was also measured for the emus. Key
                  findings were that giraffes, elephants and emus appeared to
                  show an increase in behaviors that could indicate stress or
                  agitation including vigilance and locomotion and may prefer
                  quieter regions of their enclosure during sound exposure.
                  Giraffes also increased close contact with conspecifics when
                  exposed to construction noise. While alligators did not show
                  clear evidence of noise-related stress, our findings indicated
                  that all focal species showed some behavioral responses to
                  recorded construction noise.},

                  is essential in zoos, and methods of animal welfare assessment
                  should aim to evaluate positive as well as negative states.
                  The indicators that are useful in assessing these are
                  discussed as there is huge variability in the available
                  information about the natural biology for some zoo species.
                  Wild baselines are not always the most accurate indicator of
                  what is right for an animal in captivity, which makes the
                  identification of factors to include within species-specific
                  welfare assessment even more challenging. There is no “one
                  size fits all” welfare strategy as it should account for the
                  range of biological requirements and needs, which it is not
                  possible to define for some zoo species. The different
                  approaches for welfare assessment are reviewed, including the
                  development of the Animal Welfare Assessment Grid which offers
                  an evidence-based tool for continual welfare assessment, using
                  technology where appropriate, to facilitate decision making
                  and lead to improvements in the animals’ quality of life.
                  Abstract Zoos are required to maintain a high standard of
                  animal welfare, and this can be assessed using a combination
                  of resource-based and animal-based indices usually divided
                  into behavioural indicators, physiological indicators and
                  clinical/pathological signs. Modern animal welfare assessments
                  should aim to encompass positive affective states and the
                  indicators that are useful in assessing these are discussed.
                  When developing factors to be scored for each species, there
                  is huge variability in the available information about the
                  natural biology for some zoo species and even less information
                  concerning those animals in captivity. Wild baselines are not
                  always the most accurate indicator of what is right for an
                  animal in captivity, which makes the identification of factors
                  to include within species-specific welfare assessment even
                  more challenging. When planning a welfare strategy for any
                  species, it is important that the full range of their
                  biological requirements and needs are considered, but this can
                  be challenging for some zoo species and it is not possible to
                  define a “one size fits all” welfare strategy. The different

                  captive apes, including facility design and the presence of
                  and interaction with both familiar and unfamiliar humans.
                  Several studies have examined the effects crowds of varying
                  sizes have on the behavior of a wide taxonomic range of
                  zoo-housed animals, including apes. However, previous
                  investigations of visitor effects on ape behavior vary in
                  scope and methodology, leading to inconsistent results across
                  groups and institutions. Using data gathered through two
                  long-term observation protocols, we aimed to determine how 6
                  chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and 5 Western lowland gorillas
                  (Gorilla gorilla) housed at Lincoln Park Zoo responded to
                  visitor crowds of various sizes. The dataset, gathered over 12
                  consecutive months, included both behavioral data collected
                  via focal animal follows, and exhibit use data collected via
                  whole group scans. As with previous studies, we investigated
                  if and how the behavior of the apes varied as the number of
                  visitors near their exhibits increased across several levels
                  of visitor density. In addition, we looked at whether the apes
                  in this study use the indoor areas of their exhibits that are
                  nearest the public (within one meter) at a rate proportional
                  to the size of that area, and whether their use of this space
                  changed as crowd size varied. As crowd size increased, neither
                  chimpanzees (P = 0.97) nor gorillas (P = 0.18) were observed
                  to alter their use of the areas of their exhibit closest to
                  zoo visitors. In addition, both chimpanzees and gorillas were
                  observed in this area at a rate equal to or greater than
                  expected by random movements at all three levels of crowd size
                  analyzed. Crowd size had no effect on the frequency of most
                  behaviors analyzed including abnormal, agonism, and grooming
                  (P > 0.05). We observed a slight effect of crowd size on
                  self-directed behaviors in both species though it was not the
                  case that the largest crowds caused the highest rates of
                  self-directed behavior. Although these data were collected at
                  a single institution, our findings support the argument that
                  well-designed zoo exhibits can be effective in removing the
                  potentially negative effects of large crowds.},

                  (FGM) between education, exhibit and off-exhibit armadillos (N

                  accredited zoos. In Experiment Two, the specific effect of
                  handling for education programs was investigated in an ABA
                  study design using the same measures of welfare in armadillos
                  (N = 10), hedgehogs (N = 12), and red-tailed hawks (N = 6) at
                  11 AZA institutions. Mixed model analysis revealed FGM and

                  undesirable behavior: Least Squares Mean\% of time [SEM]:
                  education: 24.95[14.52], exhibit: 9.09[4.16]; F1, 17 = 1.86, p
                  = 0.19). There was also no effect of handling specifically for
                  education programs on measures of welfare in Experiment Two (p
                  > 0.05 in all FGM and undesirable behavior models). However,
                  the overall amount of handling that an animal experienced (for
                  programs or for husbandry) was positively correlated with FGM
                  in Experiment One (F1, 979 = 9.35, p = 0.002) and in all
                  species in Experiment Two (armadillos: F1, 286 = 5.69, p =
                  0.02; hedgehogs: F1, 448 = 4.92, p = 0.03; hawks: F1, 215 =
                  4.68, p = 0.03). Amount of handling was also associated with
                  several behaviors (undesirable, rest, and self-directed
                  behavior) in both experiments (p < 0.05 in all models),
                  indicating that management purpose is not the primary
                  contributor to welfare in these species. In addition, the
                  depth of substrate provided and enclosure size were also
                  negatively correlated to FGM and consistently related to
                  behavior in both Experiments (p < 0.05 in all models),
                  highlighting the importance of housing environment for animal
                  welfare. Our findings will serve as a basis for developing
                  handling recommendations for zoo-housed armadillos, hedgehogs,
                  and red-tailed hawks, and for planning future research

  abstract     = {Zoos and aquariums have an enormous global reach and hence an
                  ability to craft meaningful conservation action for threatened
                  species, implement educational strategies to encourage human
                  engagement, development and behavior change, and conduct
                  scientific research to enhance the husbandry, roles and
                  impacts of the living collection. The recreational role of the
                  zoo is also vast- people enjoy visiting the zoo and this is
                  often a shared experience amongst family and friends.
                  Evaluating how the zoo influences this "captive audience" and
                  extending its reach to include a compassionate approach to
                  animals and people can further enhance the mission, value, and
                  relevance of their work. The modern zoo's current
                  aims-Conservation, Education, Research and Recreation-provide
                  useful foundations for the activities that zoos conduct at a
                  local and national level. However, to improve sustainability
                  of their actions and outcomes, we feel that Wellbeing should
                  become the fifth aim of the modern zoo for the future- both
                  from an animal perspective (ensuring that populations are
                  managed according to prevailing behavioral needs) and from a
                  human perspective (enhancing access to nature, promoting
                  planetary friendly behavior changes and ways of living, and
                  advancing the wellbeing of the zoo's workforce). This paper
                  provides discussion and review of how Wellbeing is already a
                  substantial part of what zoos work on as well as posing the
                  idea of altering the Recreation aim of the zoo to one of
                  Engagement, which potentially is more measurable and therefore
                  can allow zoo researchers and managers further options for the
                  collection of evidence on the local and global reach of their
                  zoo's aims. Education, Engagement, Conservation, Research and
                  Wellbeing provide a more complete picture of the roles of the
                  modern zoo for the animals (both in situ and ex situ), human
                  visitors and workforce, and to society more widely.},

                  behavioral and physical needs further the causes of animal
                  welfare in all zoo settings. However, by mitigating stress,
                  increasing behavioral competence, and enhancing reproduction,
                  health, and survival, conservation breeding programs must also
                  focus on preparing animals for release into the wild.
                  Therefore, conservation breeding facilities must strike a
                  balance of promoting high welfare, while minimizing the
                  effects of captivity to increase population sustainability. As
                  part of the Hawaii Endangered Bird Conservation Program, San
                  Diego Zoo Global operates two captive breeding facilities that
                  house a number of endangered Hawaiian bird species. At our
                  facilities we aim to increase captive animal welfare through
                  husbandry, nutrition, behavior-based enrichment, and
                  integrated veterinary practices. These efforts help foster a
                  captive environment that promotes the development of
                  species-typical behaviors. By using the "Opportunities to
                  Thrive" guiding principles, we outline an outcome-based
                  welfare strategy, and detail some of the related management
                  inputs, such as transitioning to parental rearing, and
                  conducting veterinary exams remotely. Throughout we highlight
                  our evidence-based approach for evaluating our practices, by
                  monitoring welfare and the effectiveness of our inputs.
                  Additionally we focus on some of the unique challenges
                  associated with improving welfare in conservation breeding
                  facilitates and outline concrete future steps for improving

                  years ago, Forthman and Ogden (1992) wrote one of the first
                  papers documenting some of these efforts. Since that time,

                  many captive wild species. ARB can be categorized into 2 basic
                  forms: those whose aim appears to be to compulsively reach an
                  inappropriate goal and those whose performance is linked to an
                  inappropriate motor function. Although the negative welfare
                  connotations of ARBs are well known, the precise reason for
                  their performance remains the subject of debate. As zoos move
                  forward in collection planning and to gather more evidence on
                  the biological needs of the species being kept, the idea that
                  ARBs may be part of a coping function adds more weight to
                  arguments that some species may not be suitable for the zoo at
                  all. Modern-day definitions of animal welfare tell us to
                  measure the well-being of the individual based on its attempts
                  at coping with its immediate environment. A failure to cope,
                  and hence performance of ARB, is an objective and measurable
                  welfare metric that may highlight which species are
                  appropriate for captivity. As conservation pressures on zoos
                  mount, and the need to take in more captive-naive species
                  increases, research on why captive wild animals develop ARB
                  can be used to inform practice. In this article, we aim to
                  review the welfare issues across 3 basic categories of zoo
                  animal (mammals, birds, and ectothermic vertebrates) and
                  critique how research into ARBs can be used by zoos to promote
                  wild-type behavior patterns by providing biologically relevant
                  management and husbandry regimes, which allow animals the key
                  components of control and choice over what they do and how

                  Increased biosecurity due to disease risk, for example,
                  results in animals experiencing restrictions. Outbreaks of
                  Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) have caused zoos to
                  remove birds from their regular exhibits and manage them
                  indoors or in covered enclosures to reduce the likelihood of
                  an HPAI outbreak on site. To date, there has been little
                  research on the impacts of such husbandry change on bird
                  behaviour and welfare. This paper examines the effect of an
                  HPAI-induced enforced housing order (HO) on the behaviour and
                  physical condition of a flock of Chilean flamingos in a UK
                  zoo. Using ZooMonitor to record flock-wide behaviour patterns
                  and scoring plumage condition, we collected data on flamingos
                  during a housing order, immediately after lifting of the HO,
                  and after a period of acclimation to their regular routine.
                  Results showed that flamingos were very inactive under a HO
                  and after release, that abnormal, redirected foraging actions
                  occurred during the HO and after release, and that flamingos
                  were more alert under the HO. An increase in records of good
                  plumage condition correlated with social behaviour,
                  inactivity, higher temperatures, and rain. This research
                  highlights the multifactorial influences on zoo animal
                  behaviour and shows why information on the animals, their
                  inputs, the behavioural outputs they present, and their
                  physical attributes should all be gathered and evaluated
                  together to best understand the influences of husbandry and
                  management changes on behaviour and welfare.},

                  methods commonly used in zoos to make veterinary and husbandry
                  procedures easier and safer for animals and their caregivers.
                  Likewise, operant conditioning, with its focus on arranging
                  environmental antecedents and consequences to change behavior,
                  also provided a framework for successful environmental
                  enrichment practices. In this paper, we outline the key
                  individuals and events that shaped two of the cornerstones of
                  the modern zoo: (1) the emergence of reward-based husbandry
                  training practices, and (2) the engineering of environmental
                  enrichment. In addition, we (3) suggest ways in which behavior
                  analysis can continue to advance zoo welfare by (i) expanding
                  the efficacy of environmental enrichment, (ii) using
                  within-subject methodology, and (iii) improving animal-visitor
                  interactions. Our goal is to provide a historical and
                  contextual reference for future efforts to improve the
                  well-being of zoo animals.},

  abstract     = {Abnormal behaviors in captive animals are generally defined as
                  behaviors that are atypical for the species and are often
                  considered to be indicators of poor welfare. Although some
                  abnormal behaviors have been empirically linked to conditions
                  related to elevated stress and compromised welfare in
                  primates, others have little or no evidence on which to base
                  such a relationship. The objective of this study was to
                  investigate a recent claim that abnormal behavior is endemic
                  in the captive population by surveying a broad sample of
                  chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), while also considering factors
                  associated with the origins of these behaviors. We surveyed
                  animal care staff from 26 accredited zoos to assess the
                  prevalence of abnormal behavior in a large sample of
                  chimpanzees in the United States for which we had information
                  on origin and rearing history. Our results demonstrated that
                  64\% of this sample was reported to engage in some form of
                  abnormal behavior in the past two years and 48\% of
                  chimpanzees engaged in abnormal behavior other than
                  coprophagy. Logistic regression models were used to analyze
                  the historical variables that best predicted the occurrence of
                  all abnormal behavior, any abnormal behavior that was not
                  coprophagy, and coprophagy. Rearing had opposing effects on
                  the occurrence of coprophagy and the other abnormal behaviors
                  such that mother-reared individuals were more likely to
                  perform coprophagy, whereas non-mother-reared individuals were
                  more likely to perform other abnormal behaviors. These results
                  support the assertion that coprophagy may be classified
                  separately when assessing abnormal behavior and the welfare of
                  captive chimpanzees. This robust evaluation of the prevalence
                  of abnormal behavior in our sample from the U.S. zoo
                  population also demonstrates the importance of considering the
                  contribution of historical variables to present behavior, in
                  order to better understand the causes of these behaviors and
                  any potential relationship to psychological wellbeing.},

  abstract     = {Stereotypic behavior is an important indicator of compromised
                  welfare. Zoo elephants are documented to perform stereotypic
                  behavior, but the factors that contribute to performance have
                  not been systematically assessed. We collected behavioral data
                  on 89 elephants (47 African [Loxodonta africana], 42 Asian
                  [Elephas maximus]) at 39 North American zoos during the summer
                  and winter. Elephants were videoed for a median of 12 daytime
                  hours per season. A subset of 32 elephants (19 African, 13
                  Asian) was also observed live for a median of 10.5 nighttime
                  hours. Percentages of visible behavior scans were calculated
                  from five minute instantaneous samples. Stereotypic behavior
                  was the second most commonly performed behavior (after
                  feeding), making up 15.5\% of observations during the daytime
                  and 24.8\% at nighttime. Negative binomial regression models
                  fitted with generalized estimating equations were used to
                  determine which social, housing, management, life history, and
                  demographic variables were associated with daytime and
                  nighttime stereotypic behavior rates. Species was a
                  significant risk factor in both models, with Asian elephants
                  at greater risk (daytime: p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 4.087;
                  nighttime: p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 8.015). For both species,
                  spending time housed separately (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 1.009),
                  and having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p<0.001, Risk
                  Ratio = 1.175), increased the risk of performing higher rates
                  of stereotypy during the day, while spending more time with
                  juvenile elephants (p<0.001, Risk Ratio = 0.985), and engaging
                  with zoo staff reduced this risk (p = 0.018, Risk Ratio =
                  0.988). At night, spending more time in environments with both
                  indoor and outdoor areas (p = 0.013, Risk Ratio = 0.987) and
                  in larger social groups (p = 0.039, Risk Ratio = 0.752)
                  corresponded with reduced risk of performing higher rates of
                  stereotypy, while having experienced inter-zoo transfers (p =
                  0.033, Risk Ratio = 1.115) increased this risk. Overall, our
                  results indicate that factors related to the social
                  environment are most influential in predicting elephant
                  stereotypic behavior rates.},

  abstract     = {Research with humans and other animals suggests that walking
                  benefits physical health. Perhaps because these links have
                  been demonstrated in other species, it has been suggested that
                  walking is important to elephant welfare, and that zoo
                  elephant exhibits should be designed to allow for more
                  walking. Our study is the first to address this suggestion
                  empirically by measuring the mean daily walking distance of
                  elephants in North American zoos, determining the factors that
                  are associated with variations in walking distance, and
                  testing for associations between walking and welfare
                  indicators. We used anklets equipped with GPS data loggers to
                  measure outdoor daily walking distance in 56 adult female
                  African (n = 33) and Asian (n = 23) elephants housed in 30
                  North American zoos. We collected 259 days of data and
                  determined associations between distance walked and social,
                  housing, management, and demographic factors. Elephants walked
                  an average of 5.3 km/day with no significant difference
                  between species. In our multivariable model, more diverse
                  feeding regimens were correlated with increased walking, and
                  elephants who were fed on a temporally unpredictable feeding
                  schedule walked 1.29 km/day more than elephants fed on a
                  predictable schedule. Distance walked was also positively
                  correlated with an increase in the number of social groupings
                  and negatively correlated with age. We found a small but
                  significant negative correlation between distance walked and
                  nighttime Space Experience, but no other associations between
                  walking distances and exhibit size were found. Finally,
                  distance walked was not related to health or behavioral
                  outcomes including foot health, joint health, body condition,
                  and the performance of stereotypic behavior, suggesting that
                  more research is necessary to determine explicitly how
                  differences in walking may impact elephant welfare.},

                  stock-keeper and animals involved. Although impacts of
                  unfamiliar zoo visitors on animal behaviour have been
                  extensively studied, the impact of stockmanship i.e familiar
                  zoo keepers is a new area of research; which could reveal
                  significant ramifications for zoo animal behaviour and
                  welfare. It is likely that different relationships are formed
                  dependant on the unique keeper-animal dyad (human-animal
                  interaction, HAI). The aims of this study were to (1)
                  investigate if unique keeper-animal dyads were formed in zoos,
                  (2) determine whether keepers differed in their interactions
                  towards animals regarding their attitude, animal knowledge and
                  experience and (3) explore what factors affect keeper-animal
                  dyads and ultimately influence animal behaviour and welfare.
                  Eight black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), eleven Chapman's
                  zebra (Equus burchellii), and twelve Sulawesi crested black
                  macaques (Macaca nigra) were studied in 6 zoos across the UK
                  and USA. Subtle cues and commands directed by keepers towards
                  animals were identified. The animals latency to respond and
                  the respective behavioural response (cue-response) was
                  recorded per keeper-animal dyad (n = 93). A questionnaire was
                  constructed following a five-point Likert Scale design to
                  record keeper demographic information and assess the job
                  satisfaction of keepers, their attitude towards the animals
                  and their perceived relationship with them. There was a
                  significant difference in the animals' latency to
                  appropriately respond after cues and commands from different
                  keepers, indicating unique keeper-animal dyads were formed.
                  Stockmanship style was also different between keepers; two
                  main components contributed equally towards this: "attitude
                  towards the animals" and "knowledge and experience of the
                  animals". In this novel study, data demonstrated unique dyads
                  were formed between keepers and zoo animals, which influenced
                  animal behaviour.},

                  tend to rely on assessment tools that incorporate

                  narrative review of the literature was conducted to bring

                  potential to undermine the social license of zoos and
                  aquariums. The lack of consensus on how animal welfare is
                  defined across such a diverse sector combined with and a
                  widespread belief that commercial priorities such as

                  efforts to effectively address this fundamental issue for the
                  sector. Data derived from an audit of habitats across a major
                  North American wildlife attraction revealed that holistic
                  animal welfare assessments undertaken by animal carers
                  embracing three principal constructs of animal welfare,
                  correlated strongly with visitor perceptions of animal
                  happiness. Visitor assessments of animal happiness also

                  accurate than may have previously been considered to be the
                  case. However, the holistic animal welfare assessment
                  inversely correlated with assessments of a habitat's capacity
                  to safeguard welfare as determined by the facility's
                  veterinary staff, supporting the proposition that tensions
                  exist between physical and psychological components of captive
                  animal welfare provisioning. This further underlines the
                  importance of clarity on how animal welfare is conceived when
                  developing institutional animal welfare strategies. Finally,
                  the data also showed that both holistic animal welfare
                  assessments and visitor perceptions of animal happiness
                  strongly correlated with the level of enjoyment experienced by
                  visitors, challenging the belief that animal welfare competes
                  with the commercial priorities of zoos and aquariums. The
                  audit supports the case that maintaining high animal welfare
                  is a commercial imperative as well as a moral obligation for
                  zoos and aquariums and underlines the necessity to utilize
                  conceptions of animal welfare that acknowledge the centrality
                  of the affective states of animals in maintaining those
                  standards.},
