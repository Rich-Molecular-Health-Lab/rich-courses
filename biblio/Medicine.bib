  abstract     = {A captive animal is the wild animal, which is held under
                  confinement and is dependent on humans for provision of all
                  its needs, whereas Captive wildlife facility is includes a
                  sanctuary, an orphanage or a rescue centre that provides
                  shelter and care to animals that have been abused, injured or
                  sick, abandoned or orphaned, illegally held or are otherwise
                  in need. Such a facility may be private, public or community
                  owned. In the course of wildlife conservation and management,
                  some individual animals get orphaned, sick, injured or
                  otherwise incapacitated necessitating interventions to assure
                  them of a life. In many cases during the course of treatment
                  and care, these animals get habituated making it extremely
                  difficult if not impossible to rehabilitate them back to the
                  wild. Consequently, captive animal facilities become the homes
                  for these individuals for purposes of nurturing them. The
                  welfare of each individual animal in these facilities is of
                  primary concern. Management of animals in captivity poses
                  serious challenges that range from animal welfare
                  considerations, space requirements, human skills, veterinary
                  care and visitor satisfaction to financial requirement [1].},

  abstract     = {The great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and
                  orangutans) are our closest relatives. Despite the many
                  similarities, there are significant differences in aging among
                  apes, including the human ape. Common to all are dental
                  attrition, periodontitis, tooth loss, osteopenia, and
                  arthritis, although gout is uniquely human and
                  spondyloarthropathy is more prevalent in apes than humans.
                  Humans are more prone to frailty, sarcopenia, osteoporosis,
                  longevity past reproductive senescence, loss of brain volume,
                  and Alzheimer dementia. Cerebral vascular disease occurs in
                  both humans and apes. Cardiovascular disease mortality
                  increases in aging humans and apes, but coronary
                  atherosclerosis is the most significant type in humans. In
                  captive apes, idiopathic myocardial fibrosis and
                  cardiomyopathy predominate, with arteriosclerosis of
                  intramural coronary arteries. Similar cardiac lesions are
                  occasionally seen in wild apes. Vascular changes in heart and
                  kidneys and aortic dissections in gorillas and bonobos suggest
                  that hypertension may be involved in pathogenesis. Chronic
                  kidney disease is common in elderly humans and some aging apes
                  and is linked with cardiovascular disease in orangutans.
                  Neoplasms common to aging humans and apes include uterine
                  leiomyomas in chimpanzees, but other tumors of elderly humans,
                  such as breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers, are
                  uncommon in apes. Among the apes, chimpanzees have been best
                  studied in laboratory settings, and more comparative research
                  is needed into the pathology of geriatric zoo-housed and wild
                  apes. Increasing longevity of humans and apes makes
                  understanding aging processes and diseases imperative for
                  optimizing quality of life in all the ape species.},

                  disease) is a growing concern for institutions housing great
                  apes, as it is a major cause of mortality in all four taxa
                  managed in human care. As part of a proactive monitoring plan,
                  zoological managers and veterinarians often elect to perform
                  electrocardiograms (ECGs) on their great ape populations. ECGs
                  noninvasively evaluate cardiac electrical activity, and are
                  thereby capable of providing information regarding heart
                  function. This electrical signature is transcribed as a visual
                  display of waveforms, referred to as telemetry strips, and can
                  detect irregularities in heart rhythm, also known as
                  arrhythmia. While traditional 6- or 12-lead ECGs are
                  recommended periodically as part of a thorough heart
                  performance evaluation, here we discuss the KardiaMobile (KM)
                  device as an additional primate welfare tool. KM is a small,
                  Food and Drug Administration-cleared, clinical-grade mobile
                  ECG monitor that requires only 30 s of pressure to flag heart
                  rate or arrhythmic abnormalities. We detail the training
