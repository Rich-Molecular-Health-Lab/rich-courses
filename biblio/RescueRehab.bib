  abstract     = {Global amphibian declines are one of the biggest challenges
                  currently facing the conservation community, and captive
                  breeding is one way to address this crisis. Using information
                  from the International Species Information System zoo network,
                  we examined trends in global zoo amphibian holdings across
                  species, zoo region, and species geographical region of origin
                  from 1994 to 2014. These trends were compared before and after
                  the 2004 Global Amphibian Assessment to assess whether any
                  changes occurred and whether zoo amphibian conservation effort
                  had increased. The numbers of globally threatened species
                  (GTS) and their proportional representation in global zoo
                  holdings increased and this rate of increase was significantly
                  greater after 2004. North American, European, and Oceanian GTS
                  were best represented in zoos globally, and proportions of
                  Oceanian GTS held increased the most since 2004. South
                  American and Asian GTS had the lowest proportional
                  representation in zoos. At a regional zoo level, European zoos
                  held the lowest proportions of GTS, and this proportion did
                  not increase after 2004. Since 1994, the number of species
                  held in viable populations has increased, and these species
                  are distributed among more institutions. However, as of 2014,
                  zoos held 6.2\% of globally threatened amphibians, a much
                  smaller figure than for other vertebrate groups and one that
                  falls considerably short of the number of species for which ex
                  situ management may be desirable. Although the increased
                  effort zoos have put into amphibian conservation over the past
                  20 years is encouraging, more focus is needed on ex situ
                  conservation priority species. This includes building
                  expertise and capacity in countries that hold them and
                  tracking existing conservation efforts if the evidence-based
                  approach to amphibian conservation planning at a global level
                  is to be further developed.},

  abstract     = {Captive breeding and reintroduction remain high profile but
                  controversial conservation interventions. It is important to
                  understand how such programs develop and respond to strategic
                  conservation initiatives. We analyzed the contribution to
                  conservation made by amphibian captive breeding and
                  reintroduction since the launch of the International Union for
                  Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Amphibian Conservation Action
                  Plan (ACAP) in 2007. We assembled data on amphibian captive
                  breeding and reintroduction from a variety of sources
                  including the Amphibian Ark database and the IUCN Red List. We
                  also carried out systematic searches of Web of Science, JSTOR,
                  and Google Scholar for relevant literature. Relative to data
                  collected from 1966 to 2006, the number of species involved in
                  captive breeding and reintroduction projects increased by 57\%
                  in the 7 years since release of the ACAP. However, there have
                  been relatively few new reintroductions over this period; most
                  programs have focused on securing captive-assurance
                  populations (i.e., species taken into captivity as a
                  precaution against extinctions in the wild) and
                  conservation-related research. There has been a shift to a
                  broader representation of frogs, salamanders, and caecilians
                  within programs and an increasing emphasis on threatened
                  species. There has been a relative increase of species in
                  programs from Central and South America and the Caribbean,
                  where amphibian biodiversity is high. About half of the
                  programs involve zoos and aquaria with a similar proportion
                  represented in specialist facilities run by governmental or
                  nongovernmental agencies. Despite successful reintroduction
                  often being regarded as the ultimate milestone for such
                  programs, the irreversibility of many current threats to
                  amphibians may make this an impractical goal. Instead,
                  research on captive assurance populations may be needed to
                  develop imaginative solutions to enable amphibians to survive
                  alongside current, emerging, and future threats.},

                  conservation strategies that integrate in-situ and ex-situ

                  directly to threatened species conservation through paradigms
                  such as reintroduction, head-starting, supplementation, or
                  rescue/rehabilitation/release. This in-situ/ex-situ
                  integration necessitates collaboration at all levels of
                  conservation action including planning, implementation,
                  monitoring and finally assessment to drive adaptive management
                  processes. Each component is dependent on the availability and

                  to protect species from extinction. Reintroductions using
                  source populations from zoos and aquariums offer a technique
                  to re‐establish species in the wild following extinction or
                  population depletion beyond sustainable limits.Ex
                  situpopulations are a potential source for reintroduction
                  projects but many zoos and aquariums do not necessarily
                  maintain globally rare species. We aimed to quantify the
                  contribution zoos and aquariums make to reintroductions, and
                  evaluate how European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA)
                  members have contributed to reintroduction projects. Data on
                  the contribution zoos and aquariums make to reintroductions
                  were extracted from theGlobal Re‐introduction
                  Perspectivespublications, and theEAZAmembership was surveyed
                  on historical reintroduction projects. This information was
                  augmented with data fromTheIUCNRed List of Threatened
                  Speciesand Species360 Zoological Information Management System
                  (ZIMS). The majority of species inEAZA‐member institutions
                  were not globally threatened but more than half of the 156
                  reintroduced species and 260 projects supported byEAZAmembers
                  concerned species that were threatened (i.e. Critically
                  Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable), Near Threatened or
                  Extinct in the Wild. Most species that were not of global
                  conservation concern were locally rare.EAZAmembers provided
                  animals for release, but their greatest contributions to
                  reintroduction projects were funds, staff, expertise and
                  equipment, and project coordination. Zoos and aquariums have
                  an important role to play in reintroductions especially as
                  emphasis shifts away from thein situ–ex situdichotomy and
                  towards integrated conservation management of species.},
