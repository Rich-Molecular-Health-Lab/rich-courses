  abstract     = {Zoos and aquariums are increasingly incorporating conservation
                  education into their mission statements and visitor
                  experiences to address global biodiversity loss. To advance
                  knowledge and practice in the field, research is being
                  conducted to evaluate the effect of zoo conservation-education
                  experiences on visitor psychosocial outcomes (e.g., knowledge,
                  attitude, emotions, motivations, behavior). Following recent
                  discussions among scholars and practitioners concerning
                  logistical and methodological challenges that likely undermine
                  the conclusions of such research, we identified and reviewed
                  the methods and reporting practices in peer-reviewed articles
                  published in English from May 1998 to June 2016 that focused
                  on adult visitor samples (47 articles, 48 studies). We
                  examined elements of internal, external, construct, and
                  statistical conclusion validity. Methodological quality of
                  quantitative methods and reporting practices was determined
                  using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality
                  Assessment Tool. Each study was coded as either strong (no
                  weak ratings), moderate (1 weak rating), or weak (≥2 weak
                  ratings). The quantitative methods of 83.3\% of studies were
                  weak. The remaining 16.7\% had methods of moderate quality.
                  Using an existing checklist, we also assessed the quality and
                  rigor of qualitative methods and reporting practices and found
                  that some aspects of these methods were reported more
                  comprehensively than others. For example, 69.6\% of articles
                  discussed methods for identifying key themes from the data,
                  whereas only 34.8\% reported how data verification was
                  performed. We suggest increased application of intensive
                  longitudinal methods (e.g., daily diary) to strengthen
                  self-reported data, experimental and repeated-measures
                  designs, and mixed-methods approaches. Our findings and
                  recommendations could strengthen and guide the research and
                  evaluation agenda for the field and ultimately enhance the
                  contribution zoos make to global biodiversity conservation.},

                  2011–2020 is a key initiative within global efforts to halt
                  and eventually reverse the loss of biodiversity. The very
                  first target of this plan states that “by 2020, at the latest,
                  people are aware of the values of biodiversity and the steps
                  they can take to conserve and use it sustainably.” Zoos and
                  aquariums worldwide, attracting more than 700 million visits
                  every year, could potentially make a positive contribution to
                  this target. However, a global evaluation of the educational
                  impacts of visits to zoos and aquariums is entirely lacking in
                  the existing literature. To address this gap, we conducted a
                  large‐scale impact evaluation study. We used a pre‐ and
                  postvisit repeated‐measures survey design to evaluate
                  biodiversity literacy—understanding of biodiversity and
                  knowledge of actions to help protect it—of zoo and aquarium
                  visitors worldwide. Ours was the largest and most
                  international study of zoo and aquarium visitors ever
                  conducted. In total, 5661 visitors to 26 zoos and aquariums
                  from 19 countries around the globe participated in the study.
                  Aggregate biodiversity understanding and knowledge of actions
                  to help protect biodiversity both significantly increased over
                  the course of zoo and aquarium visits. There was an increase
                  from previsit (69.8\%) to postvisit (75.1\%) in respondents
                  demonstrating at least some positive evidence of biodiversity
                  understanding. Similarly, there was an increase from previsit
                  (50.5\%) to postvisit (58.8\%) in respondents who could
                  identify actions to help protect biodiversity that could be
                  achieved at an individual level. Our results are the most
                  compelling evidence to date that zoo and aquarium visits
                  contribute to increasing the number of people who understand
                  biodiversity and know actions they can take to help protect

                  This mixed-methods study examines visitor learning from both
                  zoos’ and visitors’ perspectives using qualitative and
                  quantitative data. Five hundred and forty zoo visitor
                  interviews from nine case studies provide insight into visitor
                  intentions, which indicate that the majority of visitors
                  (72\%) arrive at zoos with a learning agenda. Over 170 zoos
                  across 48 countries also report, via an online questionnaire,
                  that the majority of their visitors come to learn. In
                  contrast, however, 28 face-to-face zoo education staff
                  interviewed at the nine case study sites suggests a different
                  conclusion. The study also indicates that zoos appear to
                  determine visitors’ intentions through a number of methods,
                  but are most heavily reliant on informal measures with only
                  15\% of zoos using both formal and informal processes.
                  Juxtaposing these findings suggests that zoos’ reliance on
                  informal measures of visitor intentions appears to provide
                  them with a less than accurate picture of their visitors’

                  global biodiversity education campaign's impact through a
                  repeated-measures survey of nearly 5000 visitors to 20 zoos
                  and aquariums located in 14 countries. By comparing visitors’

                  found significant aggregate improvements in their biodiversity
                  understanding and their knowledge of actions to help protect

                  the way zoos manage visitor-animal interactions by identifying
                  the factors that may influence visitors and the way visitors
                  interact with animals. Consequently, we investigated the
                  relationship between visitor attitudes and penguin behavior
                  and the effects of regulating visitor-penguin interactions on
                  visitor attitudes and experience. Visitor attitudes toward
                  little penguins (Eudyptula minor), their welfare, enclosure,
                  visitor effects, enclosure manipulations and visitor
                  experience at an Australian zoo were assessed. A 2 × 2 fully
                  randomized factorial design was used to examine potential
                  factors that may influence visitor attitudes: (1) Viewing
                  proximity of visitors to the enclosure: "Normal viewing
                  distance" and "Increased viewing distance" (using a physical
                  barrier set up 2 m from the enclosure) and (2) Intensity of
                  visitor behaviors: "Unregulated visitor behavior" and
                  "Regulated visitor behavior" (using signage and researcher in
                  zoo uniform). Visitor attitudes were assessed using an
                  anonymous attitude questionnaire. Visitors were approached
                  after they had finished viewing the penguins and were given
                  two options to complete the questionnaire, either on an iPad
                  on site during their zoo visit or online (URL sent via email)
                  after their zoo visit. A total of 495 surveys (48\% during zoo
                  visit, 52\% after zoo visit) were completed. Majority of
                  respondents were non-zoo members, females and aged between 26
                  and 35 years old. Results revealed a significant relationship
                  (p < 0.05) between little penguin behavior and visitor
                  attitudes where the more visible, active and close penguins
                  were to the visitor viewing area, the more positive several
                  visitor attitude scales were. In contrast, there were only a
                  few treatment effects of regulating visitor viewing proximity
                  and behavior on visitor attitudes in which attitudes toward
                  "Positive penguin characteristics" (p = 0.024), "Neutral
                  visitor effects" (p = 0.0023) and "Physical barriers" (p =
                  0.013) were affected. This suggests that physical barriers
                  and/or signage are factors that influence visitor attitudes.
                  However, it is unclear if the treatment effects influenced
                  visitor attitudes directly, or if it was the changes in
                  penguin behavior as a consequence of the treatments that were
                  associated with visitor attitudes. These findings have
                  increased our understanding of the multifaceted nature of
                  visitor attitudes and have identified some influencing factors
                  on attitudes that can be used to inform the way zoos manage
                  visitor-penguin interactions, but clearly further research is
                  required.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the effects of anthropogenic environmental
                  impacts, conservation education (CE) aims to increase public
                  awareness of biodiversity and encourage the uptake of
                  pro-environmental behaviours (PEB). One way of achieving this
                  goal is the use of controlled animal interactions with animal
                  ambassadors to promote CE goals. This study aimed to determine
                  how differing experiences with ambassador Humboldt penguins
                  (Spheniscus humboldti) affected visitors’ knowledge of
                  conservation actions (CA) and their likelihood to perform PEBs
                  in a UK zoo. A quasi-experimental repeated measures
                  questionnaire was used to investigate this aim. Visit types
                  were categorised as (a) ‘penguin parade’, (b) ‘animal
                  encounter’, (c) ‘exhibit viewing’ and (d) a ‘control’ groups.
                  A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to determine if responses to
                  rating scale items related to PEBs differed according to
                  experience. No significant (p > 0.05) differences were
                  detectable between groups. Qualitative data provided in open
                  ended questions relating to CAs were coded into themes and the
                  percentage of responses were calculated for each theme. Whilst
                  the ‘exhibit viewing’ group mentioned sustainable fish
                  significantly more (p = 0.017) than the ‘control’ group, no
                  significant difference was found for any other pair-wise
                  comparison (p > 0.05 in all cases). Overall, this study
                  highlights that zoo visitors gained specific
                  conservation-based knowledge and had higher behavioural
                  intentions towards PEBs than they previously had. However, no
                  evidence was found to suggest that animal encounters improved
                  CE outcomes. To ensure best practice is followed and CE
                  outcomes are considered equally alongside ambassador animal
                  welfare concerns, further research is recommended.},

  abstract     = {Animal ambassador encounters (AAE), where visitors come into
                  close-contact with animals, are popular in zoos and are
                  advocated as promoting connection to wild species. However,
                  educational and animal-welfare implications are relatively
                  unknown. We conducted a systematic literature review (PRISMA)
                  to investigate visitor and animal outcomes of AAE. We
                  identified 19 peer reviewed articles and 13 other records
                  focused on AAEs. Although we found net positive or neutral
                  impacts overall, several studies indicated that high-intensity
                  visitor contact and long-term exposure may be detrimental to
                  animal welfare. Most studies lacked rigour and claims were
                  based on an absence of negative impacts rather than evidence
                  of benefits. Multiple publications were derived from the same
                  datasets and there were no standardised measures for either
                  welfare or education impacts. Of the peer-reviewed articles,
                  just two considered both education and welfare. Education
                  studies often used perceived learning or only post-experience
                  testing. Welfare studies used small samples (median n = 4;
                  range 1–59), and limited measures of welfare. In order to
                  justify the continued use of AAEs in modern zoos, animal
                  welfare costs must be proven to be minimal whilst having
                  demonstrable and substantial visitor educational value.
                  Large-scale, standardised impact assessments of both education
                  and welfare impacts are needed.},

                  investigates the extent to which visitors share this view and
                  discusses the implications of the findings for the provision
                  of on-site and post-visit conservation education. A survey of
                  1,546 visitors to 13 zoos and aquariums found that although
                  visitors gave highest priority to entertainment aspects of the
                  experience, they also considered the provision of conservation
                  education to be an important aspect of a zoo or aquarium
                  visit. The findings suggest that zoos and aquariums need to
                  develop new ways of engaging visitors for whom conservation
                  learning is not the major purpose for visiting and provide
                  post-visit experiences that reinforce and extend on-site
                  conservation messages and action. Suggestions for

                  attempted to establish what this "connection" actually means.
                  Visitors (N = 85) to Melbourne Zoo were asked to name the
                  animal with which they most connected, the extent to which
                  they connected with it, and to qualitatively describe what it
                  meant to connect with that animal. Many (but not all)
                  participants connected with charismatic megafauna: primate,
                  great ape, large carnivore, or large herbivore. Qualitative
                  analysis revealed five common themes in the meaning of
                  connection: Appreciation, Attribution, Inspires Emotions,
                  Interaction, and Proximity. Overall connection level was
                  significantly correlated with perceptions of conservation
                  caring for the chosen species. Future research should aim to
                  determine what factors affect a zoo visitor's connection
