  abstract     = {Evidence-based approaches are key to advancing all areas of
                  zoo and aquarium practice. Output from empirical study must be
                  disseminated to those within the industry so that results can
                  support changes to husbandry and management for individual
                  species. Information on enrichment techniques is published in
                  a range of sources, including papers in the peer-reviewed and
                  'grey literature' (ie professional but non-reviewed
                  publications). To investigate how evidence is implemented into
                  enrichment practices, we sampled all enrichment studies
                  identified in one online repository of peer-reviewed papers
                  and two grey literature publications across an elevenyear
                  period. We recorded whether the enrichment was supported with
                  biological evidence (whether it was developed using published
                  enrichment-focused research for that species and/or with the
                  species' ecology and behaviour information) alongside analysis
                  of the type of enrichment used and the chosen study species.
                  Enrichment articles were more likely to be supported by
                  biological evidence in peer-reviewed than grey literature.
                  Taxonomic differences in the use of evidence were noted; for
                  example, enrichment provided to carnivores and parrots was
                  more likely to be supported with biological evidence compared
                  to that used for penguins. Of the five enrichment types,
                  nutritional enrichment was most often based on biological
                  evidence. Multi-category and physical enrichment types were
                  more common across all literature sources whereas social
                  enrichment was less common, suggesting barriers to
                  implementation of all enrichment types in zoological
                  facilities. Our research suggests that zoo and aquarium
                  professionals are considering species-specific welfare needs
                  by ensuring that enrichment protocols are supported by
                  biological evidence. However, opportunities to diversify the
                  enrichment types being offered and species being researched
                  are identified.},

                  is underpinned by an evidence-based approach, yet research
                  suggests considerable taxonomic-bias and in industry, a
                  tendency for keepers to rely on food-based EE despite research
                  on multiple EE categories. To better understand potential
                  barriers to the dissemination of EE information for
                  underrepresented taxa and EE types, a workshop was run at the
                  19th BIAZA Research Conference in summer 2017. Six taxa
                  (domestic species, non-parrot birds, small mammalian
                  carnivores, reptiles/amphibians, fish/invertebrates) plus
                  non-food based EE were discussed by six focus groups who
                  answered a standardised set of questions as part of a
                  semi-structured interview. Deductive thematic analysis and
                  principal component analysis were applied to code themes in
                  the delegates’ discourse and derive components. Results
                  suggest that delegates were focused upon two underlying
                  themes: animal quality of life measures, and use or lack of
                  information. Both themes were evidenced in the discourse of
                  all focus groups for each of five EE subject areas (EE concept
                  and terminology; need for EE; barriers to EE; use of
                  literature; evaluation of EE). Zoo professionals have a
                  holistic view on animal welfare that relies on behavioural
                  ecology to inform practice, a multifactorial view on EE
                  concepts, seeing EE as core husbandry, yet a luxury in
                  practice due to barriers, with reliance on literature for
                  ideas and to overcome barriers, to determine an animal’s need
                  for EE, and to measure EE success. Delegates discussed a lack
                  of literature, supporting conclusions of previous research.
                  Further EE-based research on underrepresented animal groups is
                  required if zoo-based practice is to progress.},

                  environmental enrichment to make their lives less predictable.
                  However, providing new enrichment can have unpredictable
                  effects. We evaluated the effectiveness of two enrichment
                  regimes: (1) providing only new enrichments - "Novelty" and
                  (2) only familiar enrichments - "Familiar." In this case
                  study, enrichment efficacy was assessed using activity budget
                  analysis and novel object tests. The subjects were two focal
                  animals: the golden jackal (Canis aureus) and the European
                  badger (Meles meles). Our results suggest that both assessment
                  methods provided similar conclusions about the animal's
                  welfare. The "Familiar" treatment significantly increased
                  activity and decreased abnormal behavior in the jackal's
                  activity budget, who avoided novel objects in her baseline
                  novel object test. The Novelty treatment resulted in the
                  growth of time the jackal spent in the moat instead of the
                  main enclosure, and an increase in avoidance and abnormal
                  behaviors. In contrast, the badger demonstrated a high
                  intensity of exploratory behavior in the baseline novel object
                  test, and both regimes led to an increase in the activity
                  budget of the badger. We propose that a stable, but complex
                  enrichment can be an effective robust tool to increase animal
                  welfare, but its efficacy depends on the novelty preference of
                  individual animals. A novel object test can be a rapid tool to
                  assess individual animals' novelty preferences, and this
                  information may help to choose optimal enrichment regimes for
                  individual animals.},

  abstract     = {Environmental enrichment is widely used in the management of
                  zoo animals, and is an essential strategy for increasing the
                  behavioral welfare of these populations. It may be difficult,
                  however, to identify potentially effective enrichment
                  strategies that are also cost-effective and readily available.
                  An animal's preference for a potential enrichment item may be
                  a reliable predictor of whether that individual will reliably
                  interact with that item, and subsequently enable staff to
                  evaluate the effects of that enrichment strategy. The aim of
                  the present study was to assess the utility of preference
                  assessments for identifying potential enrichment items across
                  six different species--each representing a different taxonomic
                  group. In addition, we evaluated the agreement between zoo
                  personnel's predictions of animals' enrichment preferences and
                  stimuli selected via a preference assessment. Five out of six
                  species (nine out of 11 individuals) exhibited clear,
                  systematic preferences for specific stimuli. Similarities in
                  enrichment preferences were observed among all individuals of
                  primates, whereas individuals within ungulate and avian
                  species displayed individual differences in enrichment
                  preferences. Overall, zoo personnel, regardless of experience
                  level, were significantly more accurate at predicting
                  least-preferred stimuli than most-preferred stimuli across
                  species, and tended to make the same predictions for all
                  individuals within a species. Preference assessments may
                  therefore be a useful, efficient husbandry strategy for
                  identifying viable enrichment items at both the individual and
                  species levels.},
