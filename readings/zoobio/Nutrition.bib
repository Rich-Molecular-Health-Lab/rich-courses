  abstract     = {Consumption of high-quality animal protein plays an important
                  role in improving human nutrition, growth, development, and
                  health. With an exponential growth of the global population,
                  demands for animal-sourced protein are expected to increase by
                  60\% between 2021 and 2050. In addition to the production of
                  food protein and fiber (wool), animals are useful models for
                  biomedical research to prevent and treat human diseases and
                  serve as bioreactors to produce therapeutic proteins. For a
                  high efficiency to transform low-quality feedstuffs and
                  forages into high-quality protein and highly bioavailable
                  essential minerals in diets of humans, farm animals have
                  dietary requirements for energy, amino acids, lipids,
                  carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and water in their life
                  cycles. All nutrients interact with each other to influence
                  the growth, development, and health of mammals, birds, fish,
                  and crustaceans, and adequate nutrition is crucial for
                  preventing and treating their metabolic disorders (including
                  metabolic diseases) and infectious diseases. At the organ
                  level, the small intestine is not only the terminal site for
                  nutrient digestion and absorption, but also intimately
                  interacts with a diverse community of intestinal antigens and
                  bacteria to influence gut and whole-body health. Understanding
                  the species and metabolism of intestinal microbes, as well as
                  their interactions with the intestinal immune systems and the
                  host intestinal epithelium can help to mitigate antimicrobial
                  resistance and develop prebiotic and probiotic alternatives to
                  in-feed antibiotics in animal production. As abundant sources
                  of amino acids, bioactive peptides, energy, and highly
                  bioavailable minerals and vitamins, animal by-product
                  feedstuffs are effective for improving the growth,
                  development, health, feed efficiency, and survival of
                  livestock and poultry, as well as companion and aquatic
                  animals. The new knowledge covered in this and related volumes
                  of Adv Exp Med Biol is essential to ensure sufficient
                  provision of animal protein for humans, while helping reduce
                  greenhouse gas emissions, minimize the urinary and fecal
                  excretion of nitrogenous and other wastes to the environment,
                  and sustain animal agriculture (including aquaculture).},

  abstract     = {Abstract The aim of this review is to discuss the usage of
                  insect fats as an energy source in animal nutrition. Insects
                  are a rich carrier of proteins, fat, and minerals. They are
                  successfully introduced in animal diets (poultry, swine,
                  rabbits, fish, and pets) as a source of many nutrients,
                  including energy and essential fatty acids (FAs). The insects’
                  fat content and quality are highly affected by the type of
                  substrate provided to the insects during the rearing period.
                  The majority of the studies have shown that insect fats may be
                  used as promising substitutes for conventional energy
                  resources in animal nutrition without adverse effects on
                  growth performance and feed utilization. They can positively
                  affect meat quality by increasing the level of long-chain
                  polyunsaturated FAs but may also positively influence animals
                  by regulating the gut microbiota and stimulating the immune
                  system. In conclusion, insect fat supplementation showed
                  promising results in terms of their application in animal
                  nutrition. However, compared to insect protein application,
                  very few studies have been performed on insect fats.
                  Therefore, because of the fat quality and content of insects,
                  there is a need to extend experimentation regarding their
                  implementation in animals’ diets as a replacement for
                  conventional dietary energy resources.},

                  low-molecular-weight substances with enormous physiological
                  importance. Since 1912, AAs have been classified as
                  nutritionally essential amino acids (EAAs) or nonessential
                  amino acids (NEAAs) for animals. EAAs are those AAs that are
                  either not synthesized or insufficiently synthesized de novo
                  in the organisms. It was assumed that all NEAAs (now known as
                  AAs that are synthesizable in animal cells de novo [AASAs])
                  were formed sufficiently in animals and were not needed in
                  diets. However, studies over the past three decades have shown
                  that sufficient dietary AASAs (e.g. glutamine, glutamate,
                  glycine, and proline) are necessary for the maximum growth and
                  optimum health of pigs, chickens, and fish. Thus, the concept
                  of "ideal protein" (protein with an optimal EAA pattern that
                  precisely meets the physiological needs of animals), which was
                  originally proposed in the 1950s but ignored AASAs, is not
                  ideal in animal nutrition. Ideal diets must provide all
                  physiologically and nutritionally essential AAs. Improved
                  patterns of AAs in diets for swine and chickens as well as zoo
                  and companion animals have been proposed in recent years.
                  Animal-sourced feedstuffs supply abundant EAAs and AASAs
                  (including glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline,
                  4-hydroxyproline, and taurine) for diets of swine, poultry,
                  fish, and crustaceans to improve their growth, development,
                  reproduction, and health, while sustaining global animal
                  production. Nutritionists should move beyond the "ideal
                  protein" concept to consider optimum ratios and amounts of all
                  proteinogenic AAs in diets for mammals, birds, and aquatic
                  animals, and, in the case of carnivores, also taurine.},

                  sufficient food is available, the primary goal of animal diet
                  selection is to obtain a nutritionally balanced diet. This
                  hypothesis can be tested using the Geometric Framework for
                  nutrition (GF). The GF enables researchers to study patterns
                  of nutrient intake (e.g. macronutrients; protein,
                  carbohydrates, fat), interactions between the different
                  nutrients, and how an animal resolves the potential conflict
                  between over-eating one or more nutrients and under-eating
                  others during periods of dietary imbalance. Using the moose
                  (Alces alces L.), a model species in the development of
                  herbivore foraging theory, we conducted a feeding experiment
                  guided by the GF, combining continuous observations of six
                  captive moose with analysis of the macronutritional
                  composition of foods. We identified the moose's self-selected
                  macronutrient target by allowing them to compose a diet by
                  mixing two nutritionally complementary pellet types plus
                  limited access to Salix browse. Such periods of free choice
                  were intermixed with periods when they were restricted to one
                  of the two pellet types plus Salix browse. Our observations of
                  food intake by moose given free choice lend support to the
                  nutrient balancing hypothesis, as the moose combined the foods
                  in specific proportions that provided a particular ratio and
                  amount of macronutrients. When restricted to either of two
                  diets comprising a single pellet type, the moose i) maintained
                  a relatively stable intake of non-protein energy while
                  allowing protein intakes to vary with food composition, and
                  ii) increased their intake of the food item that most closely
                  resembled the self-selected macronutrient intake from the free
                  choice periods, namely Salix browse. We place our results in
                  the context of the nutritional strategy of the moose, ruminant
                  physiology and the categorization of food quality.},

                  although using standard conversion factors only crickets and
                  superworms would likely contain sufficient vitamin A activity
                  for most species of insectivores. Waxworms did not contain any
                  detectable β-carotene but did contain zeaxanthin which they
                  likely converted from dietary β-carotene. All four species
                  contained significant amounts of both inositol and
                  cholesterol. Like previous reports all insects were a poor
                  source of calcium and only superworms contained vitamin D
                  above the limit of detection. When compared to the nutrient
                  requirements as established by the NRC for growing rats or
                  poultry, these species were good sources of most other
                  nutrients although the high fat and low moisture content of
                  both waxworms and superworms means when corrected for energy
                  density these two species were deficient in more nutrients
                  than crickets or mealworms. These data show the value of
                  modifying the diet of commercially available insects as they
                  are growing to enhance their nutrient content. They also
                  suggest that for most insectivores properly supplemented lower
                  fat insects such as crickets, or smaller mealworms should form
                  the bulk of the diet.},

                  langurs (Trachypithecus cristatus and T. francoisi) across AZA
                  institutions. We utilized survey responses from 34
                  institutions to (1) document the extent of dietary variation
                  with regard to food categories and macronutrients offered, (2)

                  identify important aspects of browse provisioning among
                  institutions. A total of 95 different food items and 229
                  common-name browse types were offered across institutions.
                  Leafy greens was the only food category offered at every
                  institution. The proportion of root and non-root vegetables in
                  the diet was highly variable. Nonstructural carbohydrates were
                  the most variable macronutrient, and their concentrations were
                  considerably higher than those food items consumed by
                  free-ranging colobines. Conversely, neutral detergent fiber
                  and acid detergent fiber contents were more consistent across
                  institutions but were notably lower than those of free-ranging
                  colobine food items. There were no significant interspecific
                  differences in diets with regard to food categories or
                  macronutrients offered. There was substantial variation in how
                  frequently browse was offered, how it was regarded across zoos
                  (either as diet, enrichment, or both), and whether or how it

                  due to their propensity for locomotor stereotypies. We
                  observed two adult male tiger (Panthera tigris) siblings kept
                  together for the duration of 104 days by round-the-clock video
                  observation. The period consisted of three baseline periods
                  with the zoo's regular feeding regime of five feeding days per
                  week interrupted by two individual fasting days, with feeding
                  occurring in the evening (B1-B3 of 14 days each). These
                  periods were interrupted by two intervention periods (I1:
                  randomized feeding times, 28 days; I2: gorge-feeding with
                  three 10-day fasting periods, 34 days). As expected, day and
                  night-time behavior was different, with the majority of sleep
                  occurring at night. Pacing, which was mainly considered
                  anticipatory, significantly decreased from 88 ± 132 min/day
                  during B1 to 20 ± 33 min/day during B3. Pacing did not
                  increase during the fasting days of I2. Over the course of
                  whole study, lying time decreased and nonpacing locomotion
                  increased. A major difference was observed between
                  gorge-feeding and the subsequent first fasting days: during
                  gorge-feeding, tigers spent a large part of the day feeding
                  and locomoting (and less sleeping); on the subsequent day,
                  they locomoted about 4.5 h less and slept about 4.3 h more. We
                  suggest that interrupting routines by fasting periods of
                  several days may be effective for reducing regular
                  anticipatory behavior and creates an across-day structure that
                  may correspond to the evolved psychological disposition of
                  large carnivores.},

                  preventative health care of zoo animals. In some species,
                  including African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephants
                  (Elephas maximus), the process of weighing can be challenging,
                  and alternative methods such as visual body condition scoring
                  (BCS) have been developed. We investigated the temporal
                  development of both parameters regarding correlation patterns
                  between them, and their suitability as monitoring measures in
                  dependence of an elephant's life stage. While BM is more
                  suitable in calves and juveniles under the age of 8 years,
                  both BM and BCS are considered equally reliable in adult
                  elephants. In elephants over the age of 40 years, BCS might be
                  more suitable for assessing the physical status. Independent
                  of species and sex, juvenile zoo elephants grow in BM nearly
                  linearly with age, and reach a higher BM at an earlier age
                  compared with conspecifics of free-ranging and semi-captive
                  populations in the countries of origin. The BCS typically
                  remains constant during this life stage, seemingly unaffected
                  by growth. In adult animals, breeding females have a lower BM
                  and BCS than nonbreeders, and BM and BCS typically indicate
                  fluctuations in the same direction. In geriatric elephants
                  (>40 years) a drop in BCS occurs commonly, while BM may even
                  increase in this life stage. We recommend regular body mass
                  recording in zoo elephants to enhance our knowledge of body
                  mass development and allow the formulation of objective
                  practical recommendations. BCS presents a valuable and simple
                  tool for complementary monitoring of an elephant's condition,

                  Feeding on browse fulfills behavioral needs and reduces
                  stereotypies, promotes satiety, and provides opportunities for
                  dietary choice and control. However, there are several

                  and the difficulty in quantifying the nutritional value of

                  mass:shoulder height ratio. Although differences between the
                  sexes for individual regions were noted (with consistently
                  higher scores in males for the neck and shoulder and in parous
                  females for the abdomen), the average BCS of all regions did
                  not differ significantly between males (4.3 ± 0.4) and females
                  (4.1 ± 0.5). Linking the BCS to results of a questionnaire
                  survey and studbook information, there were no differences in
                  BCS between animals with and without foot problems or between
                  parous and non-parous females. In a very limited sample of 11
                  females, those eight that had been diagnosed with leiomyoma in
                  a previous study had a higher BCS (range 3.9-4.9) than the
                  three that had been diagnosed as leiomyoma-free (range
                  3.5-3.7). The BCS was correlated to the amount of food offered
                  as estimated from the questionnaire. Adjusting the amounts and
                  the nutritional quality of the diet components is an evident
                  measure to maintain animals at a target BCS (suggested as
                  3-3.5). Zoo Biol. 35:432-443, 2016. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
