  abstract     = {Sensory processing difficulties are common among many special
                  needs children, especially those with autism spectrum disorder
                  (ASD). The sensory sensitivities often result in interference
                  of daily functioning and can lead to social isolation for both
                  the individual and family unit. A quality improvement (QI)
                  project was undertaken within a local zoo to systematically
                  implement a sensory training program targeted at helping
                  special needs individuals with sensory challenges, including
                  those with ASD, Down's syndrome,
                  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and speech delay. We
                  piloted the program over a 2-year period. The program
                  consisted of staff training, provision of sensory bags and
                  specific social stories, as well as creation of quiet zones.
                  Two hundred family units were surveyed before and after
                  implementation of the sensory training program. In this pilot
                  QI study, families reported increased visitation to the zoo,
                  improved interactions with staff members, and the overall
                  quality of their experience. In conclusion, we are able to
                  demonstrate that a sensory training program within the
                  community zoo is feasible, impactful, and has the potential to
                  decrease social isolation for special needs individuals and
                  their families.},
