                  living through a pivotal moment for captive wild animals in
                  the United States, with increased attention to their wellbeing
                  and major changes by businesses as a result. At the same time,
                  a desire to get up close with wild animals persists and may
                  even be on the rise. These two concurrent phenomena are
                  resulting in a plethora of deceptive claims. Through
                  ‘humane-washing’ – using unregulated terms like ‘sanctuary’
                  and participating in misleading accreditation programs –
                  captive wildlife facilities are profiting from making
                  consumers feel better. After detailing this state of affairs,

  abstract     = {Zoos and aquariums are responding to the worldwide
                  biodiversity crisis through major conservation initiatives
                  like captive breeding for assurance populations and
                  reintroduction programs. These institutions also fundraise,
                  offer education programs, and provide critical research on
                  biodiversity. Through a case study inside three accredited
                  Canadian zoos, this paper illustrates that zoos and their
                  staff members are being incorporated into many official
                  species-at-risk recovery efforts on provincial, federal, and
                  international levels. Specifically, the zoos studied are
                  involved in every stage of the recovery process, from
                  providing valuable research and habitat analyses, to captive
                  breeding animals for reintroduction, to writing recovery
                  strategies and creating recovery policy for multiple
                  jurisdictional levels. Zoo staff indicate that zoos are
                  uniquely suited to conservation because zoos have space,
                  expertise, apolitical status, and the ability to connect with
                  the public. Overall, the paper suggests that zoos can
                  significantly contribute to species-at-risk protection and

                  zoological facility and has consistently been a required
                  element of accreditation by the Association of Zoos and
                  Aquariums (AZA). Each year, AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums
                  collectively commit considerable resources to conservation
                  around the world, exceeding 150 million USD annually since
                  2011 and exceeding 231 million USD in 2019. Furthermore, with
                  195 million people visiting AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums
                  each year, there is enormous opportunity to connect people to
                  nature and engage them as agents of change. As AZA facilities
                  continue to prioritize conservation-driven missions, their
                  participation in field conservation has increased greatly. AZA
                  SAFE: Saving Animals From Extinction (SAFE)®was established in
                  2014 to encourage greater collaboration of AZA members and
                  their field partners to save species. The SAFE framework is
                  dedicated to species recovery and based on conservation best
                  practices. SAFE species programs develop 3-year action plans
                  that build on established recovery plans, evaluate impact, and
                  combine AZA facilities and visitors to increase resources for
                  research, public engagement, communications, and conservation
                  funding. Here we share preliminary outcomes of the SAFE
                  program as they relate to programmatic measures of success to
                  determine whether the framework 1) is useful for the AZA
                  membership as measured by engagement and participation, and 2)
                  increases conservation activity on behalf of targeted species
                  as measured by the number of facilities supporting a species'
                  conservation and financial investment. In this analysis we
                  utilized data supported by the AZA Annual Report for
                  Conservation and Science (ARCS) to demonstrate benefits of the
                  SAFE framework and provide insights into future strategies to
                  enhance conservation impact.},

                  the "gold standard" for animal welfare in zoos and aquariums;
                  however, no objective evaluation of this claim has been
                  performed. As the only statute providing protection to
                  individual animals in the United States, the Animal Welfare
                  Act (AWA) also seeks to assure animal welfare at facilities
                  exhibiting animals to the public. In this study, the
                  incidences of AWA noncompliant items (NCIs) at AZA-accredited
                  facilities were evaluated and compared to non-accredited
                  facilities licensed as exhibitors by the United States
                  Department of Agriculture (USDA). Based on our analysis,
                  non-accredited exhibitors had significantly more total NCIs
                  than AZA-accredited facilities, and non-accredited facilities
                  also had more NCIs related to improper veterinary care, animal
                  husbandry, and record-keeping, but not with respect to
                  personnel qualifications. Additionally, accreditation status
                  and number of regulated species were significant predictors of
                  the number of NCIs. This study revealed that AZA accreditation
                  is correlated with improved compliance with the AWA and
                  perhaps enhanced animal welfare.},

                  engage in conservation education to advance conservation goals
                  and justify the keeping of captive animals. Further, the
                  Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) requires that
                  organizations include both conservation and education in their
                  missions. Our research compared the mission statements of
                  AZA-accredited zoos from 2004 to 2014 to assess how the
                  collective goals of the community have changed. We found that
                  conservation education has become a prominent goal within the
                  zoo community. We analyzed the conservation education language
                  used in all AZA-accredited organization's mission statements,
                  and found that the majority focused on inspiration and
                  connection, which are difficult to measure. We contend that a
                  mission statement that reflects the organization's activities
                  will serve as a stronger guiding force, improve the
                  organization's ability to meet its goals, and promote the
                  organization's value in the community. We recommend a shift
                  toward skill-building and action-oriented language, which can
                  be evaluated and may better facilitate behavior change. We
                  suggest the best organizational missions strike a balance
                  between adherence to community standards and reflect
                  individuality, as a unique mission will better match

                  of over 450 zoos to develop a model of how zoo composition and
                  socio-economic factors directly and indirectly influence

                  zoos with many animals, large animals, high species richness

                  zoos achieve higher numbers of visitors and contribute to more

                  institutional and TAG levels, and TAGs are encouraged to make
                  longer term plans for imports of animals so that blanket
                  permits can be obtained. Regular meetings with regulatory
                  agencies and participation in AZA legislative affairs events
                  are recommended to strengthen personal relationships and
                  facilitate communication between zoos and regulatory bodies.
                  Zoos and Aquariums should also provide professional
                  development support for registrars to increase their capacity
                  to navigate the permitting landscape.},

  abstract  = {Since 1966, the Animal Welfare Act has been the official federal
               legislation passed to provide care standards and regulations for
               publicly exhibited animals, specifically exotic animals within
               zoos; however, in an age of major advocacy for improved animal
               welfare standards for all animals, the AWA has remained fairly
               stagnant in its guidelines for animal exhibitors. Through
               numerous articles, documentaries, and TV shows, specific zoos and
               animal exhibitors have shown many Americans that there seems to
               be little to no governmental oversight over zoos that have
               engaged in poor animal care or those engaging in often dangerous
               and cruel animal contact and breeding programs. This study seeks
               to understand the various organizations and acts governing zoos
               and the ways that they each impact animal care in order to offer
               potential policy solutions to improve the level of care and
               oversight in zoos. To accomplish this, I conducted a comparative
               analysis of USDA, AZA, and ZAA licensing/accreditation
               qualifications, their inspection protocols, and their care
               standards for zoo animals, and then five semi-structured
               interviews of zoo staff from across the US. The comparative
               analysis shows that the USDA’s standards and protocols are
               significantly less as compared to the accreditation
               organizations’ standards. As a result of the interviews, I found
               that many within the zoo industry believe that the AWA prevents
               outright cruelty towards animals but its welfare standards are
               minimal. As a potential policy solution I propose passing new
               legislation specifically for exhibitors and their animals with
               improved care standards along with placing sole licensing and
               enforcement of protective animal legislation under the Department
               of the Interior. Improving care and licensing standards along
               with oversight measures in America’s zoos is key to ensuring that
               respect and care for wildlife is a priority within the US
               government and the zoo industry as a whole.},
