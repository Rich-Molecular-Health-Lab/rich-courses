  abstract     = {The Future of Zoonomy: Unraveling the Mysteries of Animal
                  Genomes explores the promises and challenges of zoonomy, a
                  field that has gained significant momentum with advancements
                  in genetic sequencing technologies. The abstract highlights
                  that by decoding animal genomes, researchers can uncover
                  insights into evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and the
                  complex interplay between humans and other animals. It
                  underscores the potential of zoonomy to inform disease
                  prevention and treatment strategies, as well as conservation
                  efforts. However, the abstract also emphasizes the need for
                  ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to manage
                  potential risks, such as the accidental spread of diseases or
                  unintended ecological disruptions. The article underscores the
                  importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and public
                  engagement to navigate these challenges and to ensure that
                  zoonomy progresses responsibly and sustainably.},

  abstract     = {Population viability analysis (PVA) has been used for three
                  decades to assess threats and evaluate conservation options
                  for wildlife populations. What has been learned from PVA on in
                  situ populations are valuable lessons also for assessing and
                  managing viability and sustainability of ex situ populations.
                  The dynamics of individual populations are unpredictable, due
                  to limited knowledge about important factors, variability in
                  the environment, and the probabilistic nature of demographic
                  events. PVA considers such uncertainty within simulations that
                  generate the distribution of likely fates for a population;
                  management of ex situ populations should also take into
                  consideration the uncertainty in our data and in the
                  trajectories of populations. The processes affecting wildlife
                  populations interact, with feedbacks often leading to
                  amplified threats to viability; projections of ex situ
                  populations should include such feedbacks to allow for
                  management that foresees and responds to the cumulative and
                  synergistic threats. PVA is useful for evaluating conservation
                  options only if the goals for each population and measures of
                  success are first clearly identified; similarly, for ex situ
                  populations to contribute maximally to species conservation,
                  the purposes for the population and definitions of
                  sustainability in terms of acceptable risk must be documented.
                  PVA requires a lot of data, knowledge of many processes
                  affecting the populations, modeling expertize, and
                  understanding of management goals and constraints. Therefore,
                  to be useful in guiding conservation it must be a
                  collaborative, trans-disciplinary, and social process. PVA can
                  help integrate management of in situ and ex situ populations
                  within comprehensive species conservation plans.},
