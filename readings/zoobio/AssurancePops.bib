  abstract     = {Amphibians are facing an extinction crisis, and conservation
                  breeding programmes are a tool used to prevent imminent
                  species extinctions. Compared to mammals and birds, amphibians
                  are considered ideal candidates for these programmes due to
                  their small body size and low space requirements, high
                  fecundity, applicability of reproductive technologies, short
                  generation time, lack of parental care, hard wired behaviour,
                  low maintenance requirements, relative cost effectiveness of
                  such programmes, the success of several amphibian conservation
                  breeding programmes and because captive husbandry capacity
                  exists. Superficially, these reasons appear sound and
                  conservation breeding has improved the conservation status of
                  several amphibian species, however it is impossible to make
                  generalisations about the biology or geo-political context of
                  an entire class. Many threatened amphibian species fail to
                  meet criteria that are commonly cited as reasons why
                  amphibians are suitable for conservation breeding programmes.
                  There are also limitations associated with maintaining
                  populations of amphibians in the zoo and private sectors, and
                  these could potentially undermine the success of conservation
                  breeding programmes and reintroductions. We recommend that
                  species that have been assessed as high priorities for ex situ
                  conservation action are subsequently individually reassessed
                  to determine their suitability for inclusion in conservation
                  breeding programmes. The limitations and risks of maintaining
                  ex situ populations of amphibians need to be considered from
                  the outset and, where possible, mitigated. This should improve
                  programme success rates and ensure that the limited funds
                  dedicated to ex situ amphibian conservation are allocated to
                  projects which have the greatest chance of success.},

                  non‐invasive sampling and analytical tools), which may then
                  also improve the husbandry of elephants in human care.
                  Free‐ranging elephants also benefit from drug therapies and
                  veterinary care when they are orphaned, kept as working
                  elephants or brought in as rehabilitation cases – especially
                  as human–elephant conflicts become more common as a result of
                  ever‐expanding human populations. Much has been learned about
                  the basic biology and husbandry needs of elephants but, often,
                  the more we learn, the more questions arise. There are
                  physiological differences between African and Asian elephants,
                  and this should affect the management of these animals. This
                  paper will provide brief overviews of the current state of
                  knowledge regarding the pharmacology, nutrition, reproduction,
                  sensory biology and diseases (primarily elephant

                  developed a new process-an Integrated Collection Assessment
                  and Planning (ICAP) workshop. This brings in situ and ex situ
                  communities together to apply the decision process of the IUCN
                  SSC Guidelines on the Use of Ex Situ Management for Species
                  Conservation to the task of regional or global collection

                  regional zoo and aquarium associations and IUCN Specialist

                  Aquariums' (AZA) Species Survival Plans® (SSPs) have low rates
                  of reproductive success. It is critical that individuals
                  recommended to breed are successful to achieve genetic and
                  demographic goals set by the SSP. Identifying factors that
                  impact reproductive success can inform managers on best

                  Viability Analysis (RVA) utilizes data gathered from Breeding
                  and Transfer Plans, studbooks, and SSP documents, and through

  abstract     = {The "sustainability crisis" in zoos and aquariums has been a
                  sobering reminder of how limited our resources are for
                  maintaining viable populations of species threatened with
                  extinction. This, combined with increasing concern among the
                  public about the value of zoos and aquariums, suggests that
                  the zoological profession should engage in a thorough
                  re-examination of our guiding principles, philosophies, and
                  practices with regard to collection planning at global,
                  regional, and institutional scales. An analysis of AZA
                  cooperative breeding programs reveals that in order to make
                  these populations viable, many more founders and tens of
                  thousands more spaces for animals, either in existing
                  facilities or new ones, are necessary if we want to maintain
                  all of the species that are covered by cooperative breeding
                  programs currently. Regional zoological associations and their
                  associated cooperative breeding programs must be more
                  strategic and make more scientifically defensible decisions
                  about which species to try and safeguard in zoos and
                  aquariums. This would enable the zoological profession to give
                  society a "Promise List" of species that we will commit to
                  save from total extinction. Developing such a list will
                  require a collaborative, inclusive process that transcends
                  zoological regions. Regional association leaders, zoo \&
                  aquarium directors, and curators must make commitments to
                  safeguard the species on the Promise List regardless of other
                  interests. As our profession re-examines its philosophies and
                  practices and finds ways to increase its capacity to provide
                  refuge for species facing extinction in the wild, it may be
                  possible to expand the Promise List.},
