  abstract     = {Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have been proposed
                  as a means of overcoming the significant challenges of
                  managing small, isolated populations of endangered species in
                  zoos. However, efficient protocols for ARTs do not exist for
                  most endangered species. This review will focus on research
                  efforts to characterize unique reproductive mechanisms and
                  develop species-specific ARTs. Central to these studies are
                  assays to measure steroid metabolites in urine or feces and/or
                  training programs to allow unrestrained blood collections and
                  ultrasound evaluations. The resulting information about
                  estrous cycle dynamics, combined with studies of semen
                  collection and processing, provides the foundation for the
                  development of artificial insemination (AI). In vitro
                  fertilization and embryo transfer are also discussed in
                  relation to the advantages these techniques could provide
                  relative to AI, as well as the significant challenges involved
                  with technologies that require oocytes and embryos. Finally,
                  an argument is made for additional research of nontraditional
                  model species (e.g., domestic cats and dogs) and the
                  development of novel models representing unique taxa. Whether
                  these species are studied by zoo-based researchers with the
                  expressed intent of developing ARTs for conservation or
                  academic scientists interested in basic biology, the resulting
                  information will provide a unique, evolutionary perspective on
                  reproduction that could have wide-reaching benefits. The more
                  information we have available, the better our chances will be
                  of developing effective ARTs and making a difference in
                  conservation efforts for endangered species.},

  abstract     = {AbstractSeasonal reproduction is common in mammals. Whereas
                  specific conditions triggering a seasonal response can only be
                  identified in controlled experiments, large-scale comparisons
                  of reproduction in natural habitats and zoos can advance
                  knowledge for taxa unavailable for experimentation. We outline
                  how such a comparison can identify species whose seasonal
                  physiology is linked to photoperiodic triggers, and those
                  whose perceived seasonality in the wild is the consequence of
                  fluctuating resources without a photoperiodic trigger. This
                  concept groups species into those that do not change their
                  aseasonal pattern between natural habitats and zoos because
                  they are not constrained by resources in the wild, those that
                  do not change a seasonal pattern between natural habitats and
                  zoos because they are triggered by photoperiod irrespective of
                  resources, and those that change from a more seasonal pattern
                  in the natural habitat to an aseasonal pattern in zoos because
                  the zoo environment alleviates resource limitations
                  experienced in the wild. We explain how detailed comparisons
                  of mating season timing in both environments can provide clues
                  whether a specific daylength or a specific number of days
                  after an equinox or solstice is the likely phototrigger for a
                  taxon. We outline relationships between life history
                  strategies and seasonality, with special focus on relative
                  shortening of gestation periods in more seasonal mammals.
                  Irrespective of whether such shortening results from the
                  adaptive value of fitting a reproductive cycle within one
                  seasonal cycle (minimizing ‘lost opportunity’), or from
                  benefits deriving from separating birth and mating (to
                  optimize resource use, or to reduce infanticide), reproductive
                  seasonality may emerge as a relevant driver of life history
                  acceleration. Comparisons of data from natural habitats and
                  zoos will facilitate testing some of the resulting hypotheses.},

  abstract     = {As part of a multi-institutional study of zoo elephant
                  welfare, we evaluated female elephants managed by zoos
                  accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and
                  applied epidemiological methods to determine what factors in
                  the zoo environment are associated with reproductive problems,
                  including ovarian acyclicity and hyperprolactinemia. Bi-weekly
                  blood samples were collected from 95 African (Loxodonta
                  africana) and 75 Asian (Elephas maximus) (8-55 years of age)
                  elephants over a 12-month period for analysis of serum
                  progestogens and prolactin. Females were categorized as normal
                  cycling (regular 13- to 17-week cycles), irregular cycling
                  (cycles longer or shorter than normal) or acyclic (baseline
                  progestogens, <0.1 ng/ml throughout), and having Low/Normal
                  (<14 or 18 ng/ml) or High (≥14 or 18 ng/ml) prolactin for
                  Asian and African elephants, respectively. Rates of normal
                  cycling, acyclicity and irregular cycling were 73.2, 22.5 and
                  4.2\% for Asian, and 48.4, 37.9 and 13.7\% for African
                  elephants, respectively, all of which differed between species
                  (P < 0.05). For African elephants, univariate assessment found
                  that social isolation decreased and higher enrichment
                  diversity increased the chance a female would cycle normally.
                  The strongest multi-variable models included Age (positive)
                  and Enrichment Diversity (negative) as important factors of
                  acyclicity among African elephants. The Asian elephant data
                  set was not robust enough to support multi-variable analyses
                  of cyclicity status. Additionally, only 3\% of Asian elephants
                  were found to be hyperprolactinemic as compared to 28\% of
                  Africans, so predictive analyses of prolactin status were
                  conducted on African elephants only. The strongest
                  multi-variable model included Age (positive), Enrichment
                  Diversity (negative), Alternate Feeding Methods (negative) and
                  Social Group Contact (positive) as predictors of
                  hyperprolactinemia. In summary, the incidence of ovarian cycle
                  problems and hyperprolactinemia predominantly affects African
                  elephants, and increases in social stability and feeding and
                  enrichment diversity may have positive influences on hormone
                  status.},

  abstract     = {The ability to track gonadal function is facilitated by the
                  use of endocrine and ultrasound techniques, both of which are
                  important tools for optimizing reproduction and ensuring
                  sustainability of fragile populations. With so many species
                  now endangered, captive breeding is increasingly viewed as a
                  means to sustain important insurance populations. As
                  reproduction is key to species survival, understanding how to
                  control and monitor ovarian function is vital. Through decades
                  of study, we now have a greater understanding of the
                  diversity, and plasticity, of reproductive mechanisms across
                  taxa. Even within related species, there are marked
                  differences in seasonal, environmental and social influences
                  on ovarian cycle dynamics, ovulatory mechanisms, and responses
                  to assisted reproductive/ovulation induction protocols. For
                  most wildlife species, endocrine function is assessed
                  noninvasively through analyses of hormones or their
                  metabolites excreted in urine or feces. Perhaps it should not
                  be surprising then, that major differences in metabolism and
                  routes of excretion exist, not only between species, but also
                  among hormone types within a species. This means that a
                  species by species, and sometimes hormone by hormone, approach
                  is essential for developing effective reproductive monitoring
                  and control strategies. Over the past 30 years, our laboratory
                  has developed and validated a number of reproductive assay
                  techniques, which has led to our amassing a database of
                  ovarian cycle dynamics on over 100 species. This paper
                  presents an overview of ovarian physiology, and summarizes
                  comparative ovarian function research on some of our most
                  well-studied species: felids, elephants, rhinos, tapirs and
                  the giant panda, and how that information has been used to aid
                  ex situ management. Each of these species represents a range
                  of reproductive strategies, from the highly seasonal,
                  monestrus giant panda to the aseasonal, polyestrus elephant.
                  Some species exhibit spontaneous ovulations, while others are
                  induced ovulators or both, with variations in ovarian cycle
                  lengths that range from a few days to several months. These
                  differences reinforce the need for studies of species basic
                  biology to optimize breeding strategies.},
