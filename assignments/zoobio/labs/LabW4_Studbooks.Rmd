# Introduction

This week, you will begin compiling data for a **Population Management Analysis** by manually reviewing **studbooks** and **Breeding and Transfer Plan (BTP) PDFs**. The goal is to develop your **own system** for organizing data in an Excel spreadsheet and to establish **criteria** for recommending breeding and transfers.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how studbooks and BTPs are structured.
- Develop a personalized method for organizing data in Excel.
- Define criteria for selecting individuals for breeding and transfer.
- Prepare for next week's quantitative analysis using a custom Shiny app.

# Assignment

## Step 1: Review Your Assigned Studbook and BTP

Each group has been assigned a **studbook and corresponding BTP PDF** for a managed species. Your first task is to **carefully examine these documents** and take notes on:

1. **Data Fields**: What information is recorded in the studbook?
   - Individual ID
   - Birth Date
   - Sex
   - Parentage (Sire & Dam)
   - Location history
   - Reproductive status
   - Genetic information (if available)
   
2. **Breeding Recommendations in the BTP**:
   - Which individuals are recommended for breeding?
   - What criteria seem to be used for these recommendations?
   - How do demographic and genetic factors influence decisions?

---

## Step 2: Design Your Data Storage System

Before entering data, discuss **how you will structure your Excel spreadsheet**. Your system should:
- Allow for **easy sorting and filtering** of key traits (age, sex, location, kinship, etc.).
- Clearly show which individuals are **eligible for breeding** and **transfer recommendations**.
- Be flexible enough to incorporate **future quantitative analysis** in next week's assignment.

#### Things to Consider:

- Will you use separate sheets for different categories (e.g., current population vs. breeding pairs)?
- What color-coding or formatting might help visualize relationships?
- How will you label individuals with incomplete data?

By the end of this step, **your group should have a preliminary spreadsheet layout**.

---

## Step 3: Establish Your Selection Criteria

Using what you've learned from the studbook and BTP, determine **your own criteria** for selecting:
- **Breeding Pairs**: What genetic or demographic factors will you prioritize?
- **Individuals for Transfer**: Who should move to another facility, and why?

#### Examples of Criteria to Consider:

✅ Age and reproductive history  
✅ Genetic diversity and mean kinship  
✅ Institutional space availability  
✅ Health and behavioral considerations  

Your selection **does not need to match the BTP exactly**—instead, you should develop **your own justification** based on the data you organize.

---

## Step 4: Submission Instructions

Each group will submit:

1. **Your rough draft spreadsheet** (.xlsx or .csv format).
2. **A written outline (1-2 pages)** explaining:
   - How you structured your spreadsheet.
   - The criteria you used to select breeding pairs and transfers.
   - Any challenges you encountered in organizing the data.

#### Due Date: `r Sys.Date() + 7`

#### Submission Format:** Upload your spreadsheet and outline to canvas (one per group).

## Next Week: Quantitative Analysis in Shiny

Next week, you will:
- Upload your finalized data into a **custom Shiny app**.
- Perform **kinship and genetic calculations**.
- Generate **optimized breeding and transfer recommendations**.

The work you do this week will directly inform your **final breeding recommendations**—so take time to structure your data in a way that makes sense for analysis!

Good luck, and enjoy the process of **thinking like a population manager!** 🦁🐧🐢
