# Overview

The Institutional Collection Plan (ICP) is a critical document that reflects a zoo’s mission and purpose for its living collection. This assignment will guide you through creating an ICP for a fictional zoo and a specialized area or collection within it. You will draft a first version of the ICP, which we will expand and revise throughout the semester before presenting the final product.

# Instructions

## Develop a Mission Statement

### Institutional Mission Statement

- Write a mission statement for your fictional zoo.
  - The mission should address the zoo’s overall goals for conservation, education, animal welfare, and public engagement.

### Special Area Mission Statement
	
- Choose a specific theme for a new area or collection within your zoo (e.g., a biodiversity hotspot, geopolitical region, or biological community).
  - Write a mission and purpose statement for this special area, explaining:
    - How the area aligns with the zoo’s broader mission.
    - Its specific goals for housing a living collection.

## Draft the ICP

Design an Institutional Collection Plan for your new area that could be submitted for AZA accreditation. Your ICP should include the following sections:

### Objectives and Goals

- Outline the objectives for your themed area.
- Include goals related to conservation, education, and animal welfare.

### Species Selection Process
	
####	Initial Species List

- Start with a list of 15 potential species relevant to your theme.
  - Use the IUCN Red List and other resources to research species.
	
#### Criteria Development

- Define clear criteria for selecting species.
  - Examples of criteria:
    - Conservation value (IUCN status, SSP involvement).
    - Exhibit value (charisma, educational potential).
    - Resource requirements (space, veterinary expertise).
    - Mission alignment (how the species supports the area’s purpose).
    
#### Scoring System

- Create a scoring system to evaluate your criteria. 
  - Decide if some criteria (e.g., conservation value) will carry more weight.
  
#### Final Selection

- Narrow your list of 15 species to 7 selected species based on your scoring system.

### Species Profiles:

- Design a profile page for each of your 7 selected species. 
  - The information included on your standardized profiles should reflect your mission and selection criteria.
  - Here are some possible examples:
    - Scientific name and common name.
    - Conservation status (IUCN Red List).
    - Geographic range.
    - Ecological role (e.g., predator, prey, pollinator).
    - Space, care, and husbandry needs.
    
### Operational Considerations:

- Discuss the logistics of caring for your selected species:
  - Required exhibit designs.
  - Staff expertise needed.
  - Long-term sustainability (e.g., SSP participation).
  
### Review Process:

- Propose a plan for regularly reviewing and updating your ICP.
- Highlight tasks and timelines for future updates.

## Submit and Revise

### Submission:

- Submit your first draft of the ICP by the deadline.
  - This draft will form the foundation for future assignments.

### Future Revisions:

- Throughout the semester, you will expand this document to include data analysis (e.g., studbooks), deeper research, and final reflections.
- You will present your completed ICP to the class at the end of the semester.

### Deliverables for Next Week

1.  Zoo and Special Area Mission Statements.
2.  Initial List of 15 Species with Selection Criteria and Scoring System.
3.  Draft Profiles for 7 Selected Species.
4.  ICP Objectives, Goals, and Operational Considerations.

### Grading Criteria

Your draft will be evaluated on:
  - Clarity and alignment of mission statements.
  - Logical and well-defined species selection criteria.
  - Completeness and accuracy of species profiles.
  - Thoughtfulness in considering operational needs and review processes.
  - Creativity and connection to the zoo’s overall mission.
