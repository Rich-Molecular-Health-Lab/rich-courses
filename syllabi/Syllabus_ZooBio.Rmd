```

### Explanation of Interview Assignments

>Zoo Biology is an applied discipline that encompasses a much broader range of careers and expertise than most realize.

- We will take a tour of some of these careers and interests by interviewing a series of experts from Henry Doorly Zoo and other institutions.
  - You will be the drivers of these sessions, which means I expect you to do your own critical thinking and preparation before our meeting with a given expert. Each of you will post a set of potential interview questions for each guest, which we will discuss as a class.
  - One small group of students will be in charge of compiling and revising the question list for every  guest and then moderating our class interview with them.

```


## Readings

All assigned readings will come from journals and other online materials, and they are listed in the schedule below. We will use our class time to work together on some of the most important or challenging concepts, but this will not be a substitute for reading and studying the material on your own.
  
  
***You should be prepared to answer quiz questions on anything from the assigned readings starting on the deadline listed in the schedule.***


# Expectations & Assessment

## Attendance

>This is not an online or hybrid course.
  - I designed the curriculum and objectives specifically with that in mind, so to succeed you must attend and engage with every scheduled meeting. **You will not pass this class if you are unable to attend and take your own notes.**
  
Absences may only be truly *excused* if they have been registered through the Accessibility Services Center. Please do not provide me with any personal or medical details to explain your barriers to attendance or assignment completion. While I do care about accommodating these issues when they arise, I also care about your privacy and respect that office's expertise in managing the conditions and complications that are outside of my purview. I do my best to integrate a reasonable and universal degree of flexibility into our schedule and assessment plan to accommodate some work/life balance while also ensuring equity and reasonable progress in your learning. I am happy to recieve requests and recommendations to help me update and improve this approach for everyone, but I will only create personalized accommodations by working directly with the ASC.  

  
>Please also know that I genuinely appreciate opportunities to work with and around student barriers by collaborating with the ASC. If you know that you are coming into the semester with learning barriers (e.g., neurodivergence, visual/auditory processing differences), I strongly encourage you to register this with their office and then communicate with me about the ways I can work this into my approach from the beginning.

### How to Earn that Grade

```

### Preparation Quizzes 

**Many of our class meetings will begin with a short assessment of your preparation for that week's materials.**

  - These quizzes will only serve as an incentive to ensure widespread accountability for engaging with our discussions and keeping up with the assigned background material. I will ask 1-2 questions that require you to provide a surface-level reflection on some component of the assigned material in no more than 1-3 sentences.
  
Please arrive to each class on time, having completed the assigned background material for that week and brought a writing utencil. If you arrrive after a quiz is over, I will not interrupt the class to give you the quiz, and I will not let you take the quiz after recieving additional information that the others did not access before taking theirs.

```{r}
quiz.rubric  
```

### Late Assignments

While I prefer to implement as flexible a deadline policy as possible, I also have to maintain reasonable processing times for assessing every student's submissions and submitting grades.
  
>**To incentivize timely submissions, I will deduct 10% from the final grade on any assignment submitted after the deadline.** I will not accept any work from the first half of the semester submitted after our Midterm Exam, and I will not accept any work from the second half of the semester submitted after 5:00 PM on the last Friday of classes (i.e., the Friday before final exams begin). Unless Accessibility Services reaches out to discuss extremely extenuating circumstances with me, I will not make any exceptions to grade your work after the Final Exam.
  
If you have arranged formal accommodation requests through Accessibility Services for your assignment deadlines (see Section on University Policies below), then I will be happy to honor those to my full ability. **Please do not hesitate to remind me if that is the case and I inadvertently apply any late penalties to a grade.**


### Additional Expectations

```{r}
include_graphics(paste0(global$graphics, "rory_grades.gif"))

class.culture
```

### Engagement

>You will only succeed in this class if you take full responsibility for your processing and retention of the content.
  
In other words, you need to develop and refine your own process of taking notes and maintaining records to process class content in real-time and retain key points after you leave.
  
While I am deeply committed to open science, I believe that open access to teaching materials has deincentized this important facet of classroom engagement (notetaking, that is). As a result, you should not expect to access any and all slides and other teaching materials for this class in any asynchronous format (e.g., posting my slides to canvas or emailing them after class). I will provide some general class Agendas/Outlines to help guide your note-taking early in the semester, and you are more than welcome to take pictures of the slides during class or use other forms of recording to help you later, but you must attend class and pay attention to grasp the key concepts and decide which ideas or concepts are worth noting for later.
  
This also means that if you miss class, you should rely on **reciprocal** collaboration with your classmates, if they are willing to share their notes with you. This is also an important skill for learning how to work on teams and collaborate with colleagues for long-term success. ***If you do miss class, please, do not ask me to provide a comprehensive written or oral record of what you missed.*** Work directly with Accessibility Services if legitimate barriers arise, and then I will arrange official make-up options for you.


# University Policies

## Accommodations
The University of Nebraska at Omaha is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. This syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. Reasonable accommodations are offered to students who are registered with the [Accessibility Services Center (ASC)](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/accessibility/index.php), and their requests are made sufficiently in advance. 

>**For more information, contact ASC.**
>**Location**: 104 H&K  
>**Phone**: 402.554.2872  
>**Email**: unoaccessibility@unomaha.edu.  

## Academic Integrity
**Plagiarism and cheating of any kind on an examination, quiz, or assignment will result at least in an "F" for that assignment** (and may, depending on the severity of the case, lead to an "F" for the entire course) and may be subject to appropriate referral to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs for further action. I will assume that for this course, you will adhere to the University of Nebraska at Omaha policies and maintain the highest academic integrity standards. In other words, don't cheat by giving answers to others or taking them from anyone else. I will also adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity, so please do not ask me to change (or expect me to change) your grade illegitimately or to bend or break the rules for one person that will not apply to everyone.  
  
## Title IX Sexual Misconduct
As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. Title IX and our Sexual Misconduct policy prohibit sexual misconduct.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct or know someone who has, the University can help. I encourage you to [visit the Title IX website to learn more](https://www.unomaha.edu/university-compliance/civil-rights/title-ix-information/index.php).  If you seek help and want to speak to someone confidentially, you can contact the [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services/index.php).  
  
**It is also crucial that you know that federal regulations and University policy require me to promptly convey any information about potential sexual misconduct known to me to UNO’s Title IX Coordinator.**  In that event, they will work with a few others on campus to ensure appropriate measures are taken, and resources are available to the student who may have been harmed.  Protecting a student’s privacy is of utmost concern, and all involved will only share information with those who need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.


## Office of Student Leadership, Involvement, and Inclusion

>The university's former Gender and Sexuality Resource Center has been reorganized to form a more intersectional program.
  
his office is meant as a space for students to learn from each other, build relationships, and foster an environment of understanding and respect. If you are interested in contributing to or benefiting from their work to make UNO a more inclusive environment or you find yourself in need of support and resources, I recommend you start with a visit to their office. You can find them in rooms 112 and 113 of the Milo Bail Student Center or [online.](https://www.unomaha.edu/office-of-student-leadership-involvement-and-inclusion/)

## Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct

Students at the University of Nebraska Omaha are expected to maintain standards of personal integrity per institutional goals for the success of all students. This means students are expected to assume responsibility for their actions, observe national, state, and local laws, follow university policies, and respect the rights and property of all people. For more information, [see Student Conduct and Community Standards.](https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/student-conduct-and-community-standards/index.php)

## Grading Policies

### Grade Appeal

Individuals who believe that their grade in a particular course does not properly reflect their performance or that the instructor acted arbitrarily or capriciously in determining the grade should first contact the instructor to determine the rationale for the grade or if there was an error in reporting. Consultation with the instructor should occur before formal action regarding a grade appeal.  
  
After the instructor has provided the rationale for the grade in question and has indicated that no error in reporting was made, the individual may petition the department/school for reconsideration. In such instances, the student should contact the department chair/school director to obtain information on the procedures to follow in requesting an appeal at the department/school level.  

>The grade appeal process exists to correct inadvertent errors or misunderstandings about your grade, not to extend the term we've been given to work together for this class. ***Please, do not contact me after the final grade deadline to request an opportunity to revise, resubmit, or update work that has already been properly assigned, assessed, and graded unless you have already worked directly with the Accessibility Services Center and reached out to me at their recommendation.*** I will not consider any continued work on your progress in this course or attention to your materials without extremely extenuating circumstances. If you regret your performance in the class or opportunities you have missed and would like a second chance, I encourage you to re-enroll the next time I am teaching this course and follow the same standards and policies as your classmates.

### Dropping a Course  

A class can be dropped from your schedule via MavLINK until the last day to withdraw.  The last day to withdraw can be [found on the Academic Calendar](https://www.unomaha.edu/registrar/academic-calendar.php). You can click the "refund" link next to each class in your schedule if you are enrolled.  You can also contact the Office of the University Registrar to verify the last day to withdraw.  
  
Drops can only be completed in your course's 100% refund period. If you drop the course from your schedule during this period, it will not be listed on your academic transcript. Withdraws can be completed until the last day to withdraw for the semester.  **If you withdraw from a course, a grade of "W" is given for that course, which will be listed on your academic transcript.  "W" grades have no impact on your academic GPA.**
