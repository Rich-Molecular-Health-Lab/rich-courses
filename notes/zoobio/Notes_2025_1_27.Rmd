>It is important to understand that there are 2 different kinds of wildlife facilities in the United States: those that are accredited by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) and those that are not. 

- *Is this claim true though?*

# Central Ethical Questions:

- Are accredited zoos and aquariums justifiable? If so, under what conditions are they justifiable? 

# Key Agencies or Organizations:

## Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)

- more than 135 million people visit AZA-accredited institutions annually
- more than 58,000 people volunteer 
- more than 5 million hours annually at AZA facilities
- a 1992 Roper poll identified zoos and aquariums as the third most trusted messenger on wildlife conservation and environmental issues (trailing only National Geographic and Jacques Cousteau)
- reputable print and electronic media outlets produce numerous positive reports about the conservation, scientific, and educational efforts of AZA institutions.

## USDAâ€™s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)

- Licensing and oversight of over 2,300 animal exhibitors
  - less than 10% of those are AZA accredited
